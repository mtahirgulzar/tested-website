        "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In the past, adults were less likely to get braces because of the stigma associated with having metal in one's mouths. People today are excited to have the option of Invisalign therapy as a viable replacement. Getting Invisalign treatment has several benefits beyond being a convenient alternative to traditional metal braces. There's no doubt that the invisibility and relative ease of this treatment are contributing factors to its widespread acceptance. Nonetheless, comfort comes with a price. It's advisable to weigh all your options before settling on a course of action for correcting crooked teeth.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It's not hard to get Invisalign treatment, but there are a few things you need to know before you start wearing them. Here's some information to consider before committing to Invisalign:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Alternate approaches effectively resolve complex cases<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your orthodontist will do all their power to achieve your Invisalign treatment's best possible outcome. Invisalign works well for some cases of malocclusion, while it may not be effective for some complex issues. Your orthodontist will decide the optimum course of action. The dentist or orthodontist may suggest self-ligating braces made of clear plastic or metal if Invisalign aligner treatment is not suited. Options for getting braces today are less time-consuming and less noticeable than in the past.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Brush more!<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":1925,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/18a.jpg\" alt=\"When Should You Consider Getting Invisalign Treatment?\" class=\"wp-image-1925\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Invisalign uses small, tooth-colored connectors to hold the aligner trays in place, allowing the trays to \"click\" into position. These short-term enhancements are of a transparent composite polymer that stains easily from common foods and drinks like coffee, tea, red wine, berries, turmeric, e.t.c. Consequently, it's crucial to follow each meal with a good brushing if you plan to undergo your treatment in an ideal manner.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Stick to the Routine<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The use of Invisalign requires constant maintenance. Undoubtedly, the flexibility to remove aligner trays is a significant benefit of Invisalign. However, optimal Invisalign treatment entails a commitment of at least 20\u201322 hours per day of continuous aligner wear. Your orthodontist will guide you on how long you should wear your Invisalign aligners. Always keep your aligners in except when eating to ensure that your treatment duration is not prolonged.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Make it a habit to replace your aligners after eating, brushing your teeth, or flossing. Eating only three to four times a day is the most straightforward approach. Avoiding snacking is preferable to the hassle of removing and replacing the aligner trays after every meal. Removing your aligners should be limited to mealtimes, dental hygiene, and cleanings.\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Some Discomfort Is Likely<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many patients report that wearing their Invisalign aligners is a breeze. However, it's possible that some people will be more irritated than others. One's ability to tolerate pain varies significantly from person to person. If you're sensitive to pressure or discomfort, you may not like having your trays swapped out every two weeks, which the dentists recommend.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moreover, new aligners can make it challenging to speak clearly at first. You may stutter and mumble a lot. Keep your aligners in, no matter how difficult things get.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":1926,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/10\/16a.jpg\" alt=\"When Should You Consider Getting Invisalign Treatment?\" class=\"wp-image-1926\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>The Proper Cleaning of Aligners<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Avoid using toothpaste on your aligners. You shouldn't use the same method for cleaning your teeth and aligners. Because of their abrasive chemicals, the toothpaste can damage your aligners while cleaning. If you brush your aligners too much, they may get yellow.\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When cleaning your aligners, use a gentle cleanser specifically designed for use with aligners. This cleaner will allow for a thorough cleaning with little risk of damage.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Don't Forget to Floss!<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>You hear that flossing is crucial to maintaining healthy teeth and gums. Most people don't follow this daily recommendation. Flossing is essential while getting Invisalign treatment. Your teeth and gums must always be kept in pristine condition. Not flossing can lead to food particles, plaque, and other debris becoming lodged between your teeth. Residue can transfer to your aligners and cause them to fit as no longer intended.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center\"><p>\"People who smoke cigarettes say \"You don't know how hard it is to quit smoking.\" Yes, I do. It's as hard as it is to start flossing.\"<\/p><cite>Mitch Hedberg<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n<!-- \/wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Invisalign patients will experience significant discomfort if they neglect to floss. Be consistent with your flossing and ensure you're doing it correctly.\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Retainer upon treatment finishing<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>After getting Invisalign treatment, maintaining straight and attractive teeth involves using a retainer. An Invisalign retainer is provided to the patient after his treatment to help him keep his new smile.\u202fA retainer's purpose is to preserve the proper positioning of your teeth. The teeth can shift back to their original position without it. Shifting teeth may necessitate re-using your aligners, however temporarily, to correct their new positions. Consultation with your orthodontist will help us determine what kind of retainer is ideal for you.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/contact\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Contact<\/a>\u00a0your orthodontists in Pinole, Dr. Azadeh Hosseini and Dr. Ghazal Hosseini at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/\">Top Pinole Dental<\/a> to know when you should consider Getting Invisalign Treatment.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Resource:<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/invisalign-treatment-tips\/\">Invisalign Treatment Tips<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>This media\/content or any other on this website does not prescribe, recommend, or prevent any treatment or procedure.\u202fTherefore, we\u202fhighly recommend that you get the advice of a qualified dentist or other medical practitioners regarding your specific dental conditio<\/em>n.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

A kid will have 20 primary teeth by the time they are three years old and usually fall out in the same sequence as they arose. A child's first baby tooth falls out between ages 4 and 7. A child's primary (baby) tooth will get loose and eventually fall out, making a place for the permanent (adult) tooth.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>But what to do if your kid loses a baby tooth before they turn 4? For peace of mind that your child's permanent teeth are coming in correctly, schedule an appointment with your pediatric dentist.\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>However, it's crucial to remember that there are several reasons a child's primary teeth could fall out before they usually would, such as a fall, an injury, or even just the passage of time. Sometimes extreme tooth decay requires extractions. Moreover, tooth loss in children may be due to a few medical issues, including blood, metabolism, and other systems.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center\"><p><strong>\"Healthy living starts with healthier teeth.\"<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<!-- \/wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>The Value of Space Maintainers<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your child's dental health may benefit from using space maintainers since they help avoid many potential problems. For one thing, the primary teeth directly impact your child's permanent teeth, and if they fall out too young, it may lead to problems in the future. If your kid loses a baby tooth before the permanent tooth is ready to emerge, or if a permanent tooth is missing, a space maintainer may be a good solution.\u202fFortunately, your kid will only need to use a space maintainer until their permanent teeth are ready to erupt.\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The following are examples of possible complications:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Insufficient room for the development of adult teeth.<\/li><li>An increased possibility of impacted teeth and malformed eruption.<\/li><li>Crowded, overlapped, or crooked permanent teeth.<\/li><li>Communication Impairments.<\/li><li>Malocclusion (misaligned bite).<\/li><li>A greater need for orthodontic care down the road.<\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Final Words<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With care, your child's space maintainer can outlast an ideal time. Your child will require assistance brushing, flossing, and cleaning their space maintainer. Most Importantly, the plaque should not form around the maintainer. Dentists recommend avoiding food like gum, taffy, or hard candy with dental space maintainers. When your kid is wearing maintainers, pediatric dental checkups are essential. The dentist may monitor your child's development and check the space maintainer. Encourage your youngster to tell you if their space maintainer is faulty. Immediately take your kid to the dentist if their maintainer is broken or loose. Dental space management issues may have severe and far-reaching consequences if not handled properly. As mentioned in the article, premature loss of primary teeth may shorten the jawbone, leading to crowding of permanent dentition and other problems. To avoid future dental problems and maintain a bright, healthy smile, it's essential to act against tooth loss as soon as possible.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/contact\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Contact<\/a>\u00a0your Pinole dentists, Dr. Azadeh Hosseini and Dr. Ghazal Hosseini, at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Top Pinole Dental<\/a>, to learn more about Dental Space Maintainers.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Resource:<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/what-happens-during-a-routine-dental-check-up\/\">What Happens During A Routine Dental Check-Up?<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>This media\/content or any other on this website does not prescribe, recommend, or prevent any treatment or procedure.\u202fTherefore, we\u202fhighly recommend that you get the advice of a qualified dentist or other medical practitioners regarding your specific dental condition<\/em>.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

        "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Professional fluoride treatment is a popular kind of dental therapy in which a high dose of Fluoride is applied to a patient's teeth by either a dentist or a dental hygienist. Their goal is to help prevent tooth decay by strengthening weak teeth. Plaque, a sticky film of germs, forms on teeth and gums and leads to cavities. Plaque weakens tooth enamel, exposing pulp and blood supply to infection and injury. You should probably have a professional fluoride treatment if your mouth is comparatively likely to be affected with cavities or dental caries. In this article, let's overview the connection between Fluoride and its professional treatment for dental health.\u202f\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>What is Fluoride itself?\u202f<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fluoride is a natural substance that helps keep teeth healthy and strong. It's a critical part of maintaining oral health. Fluoride protects tooth enamel from decay and eliminates the microorganisms that cause gum disease and tooth decay. It's the thirteenth most common substance on Earth. Drinking water is one primary source of Fluoride in your diet. However, some studies suggest that some areas have too much Fluoride in drinking water. In contrast, others have none because Fluoride occurs naturally in groundwater in variable quantities.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Significance of Fluoride<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Teeth constantly struggle between demineralization and remineralization.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Mouth bacteria consume carbs to make acid. As a result of the acid, the enamel's outer layer becomes softer and more susceptible to decay. What you have here is demineralization. Whereas our saliva contains minerals such as calcium &amp; phosphate that help the enamel harden and strengthen. Fluoride can hasten the remineralization of enamel, which is an ongoing process.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":1908,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/826.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1908\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Conclusively, once demineralization exceeds remineralization, cavities form. Increased remineralization due to Fluoride helps protect against tooth decay.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:quote {\"align\":\"center\"} -->\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote has-text-align-center\"><p><strong>\u201cA genuine smile comes from the heart, but a healthy smile needs good dental care.\u201d<\/strong><\/p><cite>Wayne Chirisa<\/cite><\/blockquote>\n<!-- \/wp:quote -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Professional treatment of Fluoride<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A fluoride treatment involves having your dentist paint a thin layer of Fluoride (in the form of a gel, foam, varnish, or solution) onto the enamel of your teeth. It's like the Fluoride found in toothpaste, but it has a considerably more significant concentration of Fluoride and works much more quickly.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is no more straightforward method to protect teeth from decay and boost oral health. Unless you already have tooth decay or cavities, treating your teeth with Fluoride is painless. Luckily, your dentist will check for this and let you know if they find anything. Depending on the patient's dental health, a dentist can prescribe fluoride treatments every 3, 6, or 12 months. If your risk of developing cavities is moderate to high, your dentist may advise you to take extra preventative steps. Fluoride mouth rinses, gels, or antibacterial mouthwashes, available without a doctor's prescription, are examples of such preventive measures.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>The upside of Fluoride Treatment<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>A topical fluoride treatment is beneficial and well worth the price. When compared to the expense of fixing cavities, the savings are substantial. Preventive therapy, such as professional fluoride treatment, enhances your body's natural defenses against cavities. By avoiding the need for costly dental work later in life, you may save much money now.<\/li><li>Professional fluoride treatments are helpful for older adults who have trouble keeping up with their dental care routine. Cavities are more common in the elderly because they cannot correctly eliminate bacteria from their teeth. Fluoride treatments performed by dental professionals every three to six months may help lower this threat.<\/li><li>Besides lowering the risk of cavities, Fluoride may also reduce tooth sensitivity. Individuals with tooth sensitivity often find this treatment helpful in making dental hygiene more bearable. Adults often seek out professional fluoride treatments to help with sensitive teeth.<\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Final Words<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Treatments administered by dental professionals often include a high concentration of Fluoride that requires a prescription. Research has shown that the concentration of Fluoride used in professional treatments is both practical and safe. Using this amount regularly at home is not secure. Studies have proven that professional fluoride treatments are safe and beneficial every three months. Remember that your dentist and hygienist have received extensive training in fluoride application before administering it to you at your dental appointment. Because of their experience, they can determine the optimal dosage and treatment methodology based on your age and dental requirements.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/contact\/\">Contact<\/a>\u00a0your Pinole dentist, Azadeh Hosseini, DDS or Ghazal Hosseini, DDS at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/\">Top Pinole Dental<\/a>\u00a0today to know more about fluoride treatment.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Resource:<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/importance-of-flossing-in-dental-hygiene\/\">Importance Of Flossing In Dental Hygiene<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>This media\/content or any other on this website does not prescribe, recommend, or prevent any treatment or procedure.\u202fTherefore, we\u202fhighly recommend that you get the advice of a qualified dentist or other medical practitioners regarding your specific dental conditio<\/em>n.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Everyone, even kids, is susceptible to getting cavities, and if you don't have them fixed, you'll be in significant discomfort. They may develop into ulcers and cause nerve infections, resulting in severe pain and tooth loss, but dental sealants can prevent all this. Maintaining healthy teeth and gums must be done consistently every day. Every time you go in for a routine dental checkup, it's no fun worrying all the time about having cavities.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Regular brushing and flossing remove plaque and bits of food from the tooth surface, promoting better oral health. Indeed, you can't get rid of all the plaque in your mouth by brushing and flossing alone. Contrarily, dental sealants have shown promise in reducing the risk of new cavities developing or in halting the spread of existing ones.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Definition<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Teeth may have a thin plastic coating glued to protect them against decay; this is called a dental sealant, often coated on the biting surfaces of rear teeth (premolars and molars). The sealant hardens almost instantly in the tooth's crevices and ridges, protecting the enamel underneath.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":1901,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/798.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1901\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Role in maintaining oral health<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>The most significant benefit of practicing good oral hygiene is improved dental health. Dental fillings restore teeth and stop cavities from spreading. Although, dentists advocate applying dental sealants on chewing surfaces to prevent cavities from forming in the first place.<\/li><li>The natural design of molars and premolar chewing surfaces leaves them susceptible to cavities. These cracks may be as deep as human hair and as tiny as a toothbrush bristle, making them very challenging to clean. Since these are the hit spots for plaque buildup, cavities start forming from here. Eventually, to prevent cavity buildup, dental sealants fill the curves and grooves with a smooth coating, thus providing an additional layer of defense against decay.<\/li><li>According to the guideline established in 2016 by the ADA CSA and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry (AAPD), based on a thorough evaluation of the research, the use of sealants is superior to the use of fluoride varnishes or no treatment at all in preventing and reversing oral cavities of primary and permanent molars in kids and teens.<\/li><li>The guideline also confirms that the sealant-protected tooth is less likely to develop other non-cavitated oral cavities (also called early lesions).<\/li><li>There is no health issue with BPA exposure from any dental material, even though dental products intended to treat and prevent caries, such as dental sealants, might contribute to extremely low-level exposure for a few hours after application.<\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Candidates for Dental Sealants<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental sealants may serve as an effective preventative measure to avoid cavities between 6 and 14. Dentists recommend undergoing this treatment as soon as molar teeth erupt in a child's mouth. Children and teens are good candidates for bonds because they are more likely to develop decay in the downturns and creases of the molar teeth. Nonetheless, this treatment is also helpful for adults, even if their molars are free of disease and fillings.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Baby teeth may also benefit from dental sealants if they have deep grooves and depressions that may trap food and bacteria. Since baby teeth are crucial in maintaining the proper spacing for adult dentition, taking care of them is necessary, so they don't fall out too prematurely.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>To Sum-up<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Proper dental hygiene entails taking preventive measures to ensure continued excellent oral health. The protection of one's oral health is of the utmost importance. It's best to invest in dental care that will pay off in the long run since individual procedures may add up quickly. That is why you should contact your dentist soon about obtaining dental sealants.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If your dentist recommends sealant, it might be the most economical and healthful choice you can make. In the end, you can avoid cavities, and the sealant treatment can be more effective if you maintain excellent dental hygiene by brushing twice daily.

Modern technology and advanced research have assisted in changing the minds of dentists and the general public. Root canal therapy is now a viable and widely acknowledged therapeutic option.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Modern root canal treatment is a sophisticated procedure and is nothing like old sayings. It's similar to getting a filling; depending on your tooth's health and other factors, you may only need a couple of sessions to get it done. Root canal therapy is safe, quick, and very effective. In a short time, you'll be able to eat normally and smile widely again.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:pullquote -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>\"Homework, Root canals, and deadlines are the important things in life, and only when we have these major dramas taken care of, can we presume to look at larger questions.\"<\/p><cite>Cynthia Heimel<\/cite><\/blockquote><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:pullquote -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Any problem affecting a tooth's pulp requires endodontic treatment as the most effective course of action. Your dentist's recommendation of root canal therapy is, hopefully, an indication that you can save the tooth. To better understand why a dentist would recommend root canal therapy, let's take a look at the most critical determining factors:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Infections<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Standard root canal therapy aims to provide the dentist access to the pulp to remove the affected tissue and stop the infection from spreading. The dentist will likely prescribe antibiotics to kill any remaining bacteria before filling and capping the affected tooth. Your dentist will also assess any nerve injury and further enamel damage.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":1896,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/753.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1896\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Cavities<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>During regular dental check-ups, you catch the cavities in good time; root canal therapy is the safest and most effective approach to keeping the tooth alive unless you want to risk losing it. While it's true that the dentist will remove the decaying or damaged areas, this procedure will increase the patient's chances of successfully retaining the tooth for a more extended time.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Tooth Abscess<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When a tooth's pulp becomes infected, it may spread to the bone and soft tissues around the tooth root, complicating treatment and causing an abscess. This blister may cause pain, swelling, and poor taste in the mouth around the affected tooth. Root canal treatment is essential to rescue the tooth from infection in the tooth, bone, and pulp. Tooth extraction is, unfortunately, the only other option.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Extreme heat or cold sensitivity<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Every person has a baseline amount of sensitivity to heat and cold. However, if you're getting more sensitive after consuming cold or hot, take action promptly and visit your dentist right away. In most cases, infection near the tooth's root suggests an issue with the tooth itself. Here, saving the tooth necessitates root canal therapy to prevent future deterioration.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Gum Infections<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If your dental pain comes and goes and you neglect it, the present infection will do more harm than only weaken the pulp left. The pain level may startle you if you've never had a gum infection. Dentin will become brittle, and the infection may extend to the gums if left untreated.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Additionally, infected gums do more than bleed a bit. Over time, they may deteriorate tissue and even potentially compromise bone strength. Doing nothing might have costly long-term consequences. When you compare what may happen to the relatively cheap cost of a root canal, it's wise to get the operation done now to avoid the discomfort and expense of more extensive dental surgery later.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Dental Restorations<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Each restoration causes stress to the tooth and pulp, particularly in large, in-depth fillings. In extreme cases, this might result in a disease known as chronic pulpitis, in which the tooth pulp remains inflamed for an extended period. Eventually, pulp death may occur, making root canal therapy crucial to preserve the tooth.\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moreover, cracks in old fillings or crowns can also bring oral bacteria or infection inside the pulp. The need for a root canal, in this case, is obvious.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Overview<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Root canal therapy may be necessary for various medical reasons, but keeping the natural tooth wherever possible is always the better option. The benefits of endodontic treatment include a restored ability to smile confidently, eat all your favorite foods without fear, and reduce the frequency with which you'll require future dental work. Taking good care of your tooth and crown after root canal therapy should last the rest of your life.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/contact\/\">Contact<\/a>&nbsp;your Pinole dentists, Dr. Azadeh Hosseini and Dr. Ghazal Hosseini at&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/\">Top Pinole Dental<\/a>&nbsp;today for more information on Root Canal Treatment.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Resource:<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/what-is-root-canal-therapy\/\">What Is Root Canal Therapy?<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>This media\/content or any other on this website does not prescribe, recommend, or prevent any treatment or procedure.\u202fTherefore, we\u202fhighly recommend that you get the advice of a qualified dentist or other medical practitioners regarding your specific dental condition<\/em>.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Dentures may make your lips, cheeks, and chin seem fuller. The most significant upside is by design &amp; function; dentures appear just like your natural teeth. There's a chance that getting dentures will make your smile even more attractive. Let's explore which type of dentures may fit and serve you properly.\u202f\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>What are Dentures?\u202f<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dentures are removable dental prosthetics that may fill gaps left by lost teeth. Because the teeth on each side of the hole have to compensate for the missing one, they may grow at an angle and make chewing and speaking difficult. Dentures' replacement teeth may be acrylic (plastic), nylon, or metal and are detachable. They are custom-made to fit securely over your gums and replace your missing teeth.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Available Types of Dentures<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Understanding the similarities and differences between the many denture options is the best method for settling on a choice.

Traditional dentures are not of appropriate fit until the gums have had time to recover and change form. After the dentist extracts your teeth and the gum tissue has begun to heal, a conventional denture usually takes eight to twelve weeks for permanent fixing.\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":1890,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/720.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1890\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Immediate dentures<\/strong>: Immediate dentures are prosthetic teeth inserted in the mouth immediately after your dentist extracts the tooth. Therefore, the patient may continue to eat and speak normally while their gums recover. However, jawbone and gums tend to recede with time, particularly after extraction. That is why immediate dentures have the drawback of needing relining or remaking several times within a few months to fit correctly throughout the healing period.                         Immediate dentures are a short-term option until your gums, and permanent dentures are ready.

Complete dentures are often created to order and are adjusted to the patient's mouth over time to provide a comfortable and natural fit.

It is a replacement tooth that looks, feels, and functions like your natural teeth. They are a great permanent solution to restore your smile. Titanium and other biocompatible materials fabricate the core of dental implants. Posts are surgically implanted in the upper or lower jaw to secure replacement teeth.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"center\",\"id\":1885,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/09\/669.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1885\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Which Type of Implant is for you?\u202f<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Many dental implant options exist for replacing lost, broken, or damaged teeth.

Since the dental implant abutment sits on top of the jawbone in a subperiosteal implant, it becomes a one-stage procedure. Hence, there is no need for a second procedure to secure the replacement tooth inside the jawbone permanently.\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Those with weak or insufficient jawbones often need subperiosteal implants. The placement of a subperiosteal dental implant is often safer and requires far less tissue removal than other types of Implants. Therefore, they are ideal for those who do not want to undergo a more extensive surgical\u202foperation.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Endosteal implants<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Fusion of implant into the jawbone is a significant part of Endosteal implant, which is the opposite of subperiosteal implants. Therefore, an endosteal implant often provides more stability and durability than a subperiosteal implant. It's possible, however, that the treatment will be more intrusive. In most cases, patients who want to have endosteal implants must be in excellent health overall.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An endosteal implant process typically consists of two separate surgical stages:\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\n<ol><li>The first step is having surgery to attach the screw-like device to the jaw permanently.\u202f<\/li><li>When the implant fuses with the jawbone, a second operation reveals the abutment tooth and secures the replacement tooth.\u202f<\/li><\/ol>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>All-on-4 or 6 Dental Implants<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If the patient requires to replace all of his teeth, top or bottom but doesn't want to have dentures, he may want to consider all-on-4 or 6. Replacement teeth, at least temporarily, may be implanted the same day with unique abutments. You'll need to eat a special diet until the gums have healed and the implants have fused with the bone. Within roughly six months, you will have your permanent complete arch replacement inserted, at which point you may generally eat again.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Implant Overdentures<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Implant overdentures are a fantastic option if you're healthy enough to have teeth extracted. This option is suitable when a fixed implant or complete denture can't address a patient's needs. Compared to conventional dentures, overdentures benefit from the added stability of implant support.\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When factors like aesthetics, speech, and oral hygiene are essential, certain patients with soft and hard tissue defects cannot have a fixed implant prosthesis.

The best method to protect your teeth is to avoid problems in the first place by practicing proper dental hygiene, but being prepared for an emergency is also important. You may prevent permanent damage and get your mouth health back on track if you act quickly and get the appropriate first aid treatment. Let's explore dental emergencies to understand how to handle such a scenario.\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Strains and Sprains of Soft Tissues<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Lips, gums, the inside of the cheeks, and the tongue are all examples of soft tissues found in the mouth. Call your emergency dentist for advice on what to do if one of these structures is compromised. Visiting an emergency department or a dentist on the same day is possible but not always necessary. First, cleanse the wound with warm water to stop bleeding from cuts, punctures, and rips to soft tissue.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Cracked teeth<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":1874,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/625.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1874\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While injuries to baby teeth may not need immediate medical attention, they may cause significant problems for their adult counterparts.

Dentine injuries of greater severity need emergency care because of the risk of pulpal infection.

This pain often spreads to the homolateral ear, temple, or face. Even if the discomfort goes away on its own, the patient should still see a dentist since even if the pulp hasn't necrosed, it might lead to an acute dental abscess if left untreated.\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>\u202fTooth decay is only one of several potential causes of pain. Sometimes a toothache may be dealt with without seeing a dentist immediately, but when symptoms like swelling present themselves, it's time to get help directly. You should avoid taking Aspirin and other over-the-counter pain relievers since they contain ingredients that might burn the gum tissue if they come into contact with it.

Still, they may shatter or stab your cheeks and gums. This causes pain and may halt or reverse teeth-straightening efforts.

Avulsed teeth are dental emergencies, and one should seek treatment right away. Teeth treated within 30 to 60 minutes have the most effective success rate. Keep the tooth in long-life milk or saline until you can visit a dentist or doctor. When a tooth is out entirely, your doctor will likely try to reconnect it via reimplantation.\u202fAnother handy tip:\u202fWater (due to isotonic damage from extended contact), disinfectants, bleach, and fruit juice are all inappropriate and mildly harmful fluids to keep the tooth in till you reach your dentist.\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most dental emergencies include pain, bleeding, or orofacial injuries and hence need the attention of a dentist.

This rise in germs may cause gingivitis and periodontitis if ignored. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Any decay or new cavity that develops around the edge of a dental crown on a healthy natural tooth is a risk. A root canal is necessary when a hole becomes big enough to harm the tooth's nerve.

Tooth enamel is a barrier between the inner tooth tissues and anything that comes in contact with the teeth outside surface. To provide a proper fit for a dental crown, your dentist removes a portion of your tooth's enamel. Unfortunately, a dental crown diminishes enamel thickness, making teeth more vulnerable to environmental stimuli. If your teeth are sensitive or a crowned tooth still retains a nerve, hot or cold meals and beverages may cause pain. Your dentist may advise you to use a toothpaste made specifically for people with sensitive teeth.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Bite Concerns<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Despite the enamel shaving, your crowned tooth may be larger than before in height and girth. This increase in size may alter your bite, causing your crowned tooth to come in touch with its opposing teeth. A biting issue might cause discomfort while eating, moving your jaw, or talking.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Moreover, an excessively high crown on the tooth is frequently the cause of pain or sensitivity while biting down.

Afterward, the dentist will take a dental imprint of the problematic tooth and the surrounding teeth. The pattern goes to the dental lab, and the work to fabricate your indirect filling will start. Meanwhile, the hollow chunk formed in your tooth by removing an old filling or cavity is filled with a temporary filler to protect against further damage. In a second appointment, the dentist will take out the temporary filling and examine the indirect inlays\/onlays restoration model for proper fit. If it is a good fit, your dentist will permanently bond it to the surface of your tooth.

A dental inlay covers the space between your teeth's crests and only repairs the tooth's biting surfaces. Your dentist will acquire a carefully crafted porcelain inlay model to match the area left by the extraction of your natural teeth. This treatment aims to stop food and other germs from getting beneath your filling and causing more deterioration.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Definition of an Onlay<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Partially crowning your tooth is another term for an onlay since it may repair the biting surface of the tooth as well as one or more chewing cusps\/bumps of your tooth. For instance, an onlay may be necessary if cavity decay is visible in the center or side of your tooth.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When it is required to remove and fill a more significant portion of your tooth, onlay is the right solution because an inlay is possible in a small or only in the middle part of the tooth. However, onlay will take up less space than a dental crown. A crown is a cap covering the whole surface of a tooth to restore its function.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Why Porcelain?\u202f<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental Inlays\/Onlays are available in gold, Porcelain, or composite materials. But following are the benefits of Porcelain materials which knock every other option out of the park.\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":1856,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/423.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1856\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>In addition to being inherently transparent, Porcelain can easily match the hue of the patient's tooth.

Our expert dentists can guide you on the type suitable for your particular case.\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even though veneers are well-known for their cosmetic advantages, some patients may misunderstand what they can do to improve the appearance and functionality of their smiles. Let's take a closer look at a few misconceptions about Porcelain Veneers in this article.\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>You have limited options<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":1852,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/357.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1852\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your dentist will analyze your oral health and discuss treatment options to decide whether you are a candidate for porcelain veneers. Most dentists favor the least invasive treatments. Your dentist should examine options that achieve the least invasive procedure with minimum to no tooth structure removal. Suppose you and your dentist believe veneers are the best choice. In that case, the following stage includes reviewing treatment specifics, including preparing your teeth for your particular veneer process and what will be needed for them to appear and fit appropriately.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The flexibility of the process is you'll help create your smile. You guarantee your treatment meets your expectations by providing your choices for porcelain veneer form, length, breadth, color, and smile alteration. The procedure is anything but limited.\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>They will change color or, worse, stain\u202f<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>No, porcelain veneers don't discolor since they aren't porous like tooth enamel. It is the key characteristic of porcelain material. There are a few reasons your natural teeth may not match your veneers. Your natural teeth may be darker or yellower than your veneers due to the consumption of coffee, tea, and red wine, giving the impression that your porcelain veneer is staining when it is the other way around. You may want to consider getting new veneers if the color of your old ones is darker than your natural teeth. If this is the case, your old veneers are probably not of a porous material. Therefore it's time to get them redone.\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Teeth grinding will not affect your veneers<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Like your natural teeth, night-time grinding (consciously) will wear down your veneers over time. Wearing a night-time bite guard will protect your teeth from the strain of grinding and clenching.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>It is going to draw attention<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There is a widespread belief that veneers are undetectable to the naked eye. Due to advances in dental technology, porcelain veneers can match your natural teeth' form, size, thickness, and color. Consequently, porcelain veneers seem realistic and are often unnoticeable by anybody other than your dentist.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Porcelain veneers are prone to breakage<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Porcelain veneers are equally as robust as your tooth's natural enamel. Thus, this is a misconception. Aside from normal wear and tear like your natural teeth, careful care and cleanliness maintenance will ensure they survive for many years.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Veneers are merely for looks<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":1851,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/355.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1851\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Cosmetic dentistry uses porcelain veneers to cover the front surfaces of teeth to disguise flaws such as worn enamel, uneven spacing or alignment, discoloration, and even minor chips and fractures. Porcelain's exceptional resilience makes it possible for veneers to do more than improve your smile's aesthetics; they may shield your teeth from injury or decay. Moreover, porcelain veneers may treat misalignment, significant gaps, and teeth yellowing.\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Finally<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Are you feeling confident about getting Porcelain Veneers now?

The whitening treatment removes stains and discoloration from the enamel of your teeth, making your smile seem more young and healthy. If you've been contemplating whitening your teeth, here are some frequently asked inquiries and solutions.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>What is the process of teeth whitening?<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>First, you'll need to see the dentist couple of times to let him examine your dental health and any underlying problem. Dental cleanings remove plaque and tartar. However, stains can remain in the dentin. The dental bleaching solution combined with oxygen from the air and carbon in the dentin breaks up stained molecules.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":1845,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/321.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1845\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>In Laser or Power Whitening, the dentist paints a bleaching substance on your teeth. After this, he will shine a light or laser on them to stimulate the whitening.\u202f<\/li><li>For the take-home whitening kit, the dentist will create a mouthguard from an imprint of your teeth and give you bleaching gel instructions. Apply the gel on your mouthguard at home for a few weeks. Some whitening gels may be kept for 8 hours, bringing quicker results.<\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>How effective is teeth whitening done by a professional?<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The efficacy of professional teeth whitening relies on the tooth's condition. Professional teeth whitening may whiten teeth 8-9 shades. On the other hand, it usually restores teeth to their whitest possible shade. In most cases, it resembles the tint of the patient's teeth as an adolescent. This treatment effectively removes nicotine, coffee, tea, medicinal, and other dental stains.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Who might benefit from teeth whitening?<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Anyone with healthy gums and teeth may benefit from professional teeth whitening. Although, it won't lighten or darken your prior dental work.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Is dental cleaning done later or before teeth whitening?\u202f<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Regular dental cleanings are vital for your health and provide the most significant whitening outcomes. Plaque and tartar-free teeth are ideal for teeth whitening. Furthermore, your dentist can whiten your teeth and perform a dental cleaning on the same day.\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Is the procedure painful?<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Professional teeth whitening is painless in the vast majority of situations. However, you may experience some sensitivity if your enamel is weak. If that is the case, it should only last a few days.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>What is discoloring my teeth?<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":1844,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/07\/323.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1844\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Teeth whitening doesn't work on all stains and discolorations. For instance, yellow teeth bleach better than grey, brown, or black teeth. Your dentist can assist you in determining the reason for your discoloration and whether professional whitening can help. Various food and beverages can share the blame for discoloration. Moreover, your dentist might suggest you quit smoking and stop taking a few medications to preserve your whitening procedure. Finally, if a hidden dental condition causes discoloration, it must be fixed first.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Why not perform at-home whitening?<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Whitening strips are widely accessible; however, they can't replace professional whitening. DIY whitening might irreversibly damage enamel. When misused, at-home whitening products might produce significant irritation or even no results.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On the other hand, your dentist performs teeth whitening procedures. Consequently, you'll notice spectacular results in a shorter time and much less chance of side effects.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Should I whiten my teeth after getting crowns or implants?<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is crucial to know that before getting a crown, implant, or any restorative or cosmetic dental procedure, schedule your teeth whitening appointment. The material used in crowns or implants doesn't lighten upon cleaning. However, replacing the crown or removing part of the material is feasible to create a lighter overlay to achieve a homogenous smile.\u202f<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/contact\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Contact<\/a>\u00a0your dentists in Pinole, Dr. Azadeh Hosseini, and Dr. Ghazal Hosseini at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Top Pinole Dental<\/a>, today to know more about teeth whitening.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Resource:<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/teeth-whitening-advantages\/\">Teeth Whitening Advantages<\/a><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><em>This media\/content or any other on this website does not prescribe, recommend, or prevent any treatment or procedure.\u202fTherefore, we\u202fhighly recommend that you get the advice of a qualified dentist or other medical practitioners regarding your specific dental condition<\/em><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

Regular dental checkups and cleanings promise us excellent oral health and well-being. Keeping your teeth and mouth healthy not only helps prevent cavities but may also have a positive impact on the rest of your health. It is vital to see your dentist regularly. Our family-style dental care believes that each member of your household should take care of their teeth by visiting us twice a year. If you are still in doubt, let's look at the Significance of Dental Exams.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Precisely what does a dental examination entails?<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Examining your teeth and gums is the primary purpose of a dental exam. The maintenance of good oral health necessitates regular checkups. If left untreated, oral health issues can progress to a point where they are unpleasant and debilitating. Typically, both a dentist and dental hygienist can conduct the following actions in a routine exam:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":1828,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/115.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1828\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li>Neck, face, jaw, and lymph nodes checkup.<\/li><li>Checking gum for any sign of infection.<\/li><li>Examining for any sign of chipped, cracked, or loose teeth.<\/li><li>Checking the status of already done treatments.<\/li><li>A closer look into your bite.<\/li><li>Taking dental X-ray.<\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>On top of getting your mouth professionally cleaned twice a year, dental exams are crucial because:<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>A chance to check for cavities:\u202f<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your next dental exam allows your dentist to spot cavities early. You don't have to wait to see the dentist until you're in excruciating discomfort. Untreated cavities can develop abscesses and even bloodstream infections.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Preventive Dentistry can save your bucks:\u202f<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":1829,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/114.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1829\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Routine dental exams are cheaper than treating oral health concerns. Preventive dentistry aims to avert oral health problems like tooth decay and gum disease by preventing them from occurring in the first place. Regular dental checkups give our dentists a chance to examine your teeth for any deterioration symptoms so that we can preserve your teeth sooner.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>A chance to teach proper oral hygiene at home:\u202f<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Correct brushing and flossing are essential to your daily oral hygiene regimen. You're hurting your dental health if you don't eliminate plaque. Our dental hygienists can advise you on maintaining good oral health at home during these checkups.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Preventing oral cancer:<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Oral cancer is curable if caught early enough. Dental professionals check for indicators of oral cancer, usually in the form of dead tissues because of a tumor in the mouth.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Catch Bruxism early:\u202f<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Sometimes conscious or unconscious clenching or grinding your teeth weakens the structure capability of your teeth. Due to routine checkups, your dentist can suggest night guard for bruxism therapy before it's too late.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Keep biting irregularities at bay:<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Jaw abnormalities can cause chronic headaches and ear discomfort if left untreated. To alleviate your pain, your dentist may suggest night guards, cortisone injections, bite adjustments, or orthodontics and save you from later needed surgical treatments.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Conclusion:<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A healthy mouth may affect your entire health. Therefore it's essential to pay attention to it. Routine dental exams can alert you by showing early signs of diabetes, heart problems, and a few other serious health issues.

Many studies have shown that people frequently do not clean their teeth properly. In most situations, their cleaning methods and practices cause more harm than benefit. You may even wonder why you have dental issues despite cleaning your teeth. It is necessary to visit your dentist regularly to get your teeth cleaned. Most dentists recommend that you come in for cleaning procedures every six months. Discussing your dental cleaning methods with your dentist is significant.

Prophylactic teeth cleanings, clean, healthy teeth to keep them free of tooth decay and gum disease. They use a dental scaler or a water stream to remove plaque and tartar from the teeth' front, back, and sides. Most dental patients need a prophylaxis cleaning, especially if they have been practicing regular dental care and attending semi-annual dental checkups.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Debridement teeth cleaning<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Debridement teeth cleaning is the most extensive form of teeth cleaning. This type of teeth cleaning removes large quantities of plaque and tartar from teeth. Because plaque hardens into tartar, vast amounts of tartar are very hard, so your dentist will use an electrical instrument during extensive debridement cleanings to release tartar from your mouth. Dentists perform prophylaxis cleaning to clean the teeth after removing excess plaque and tartar thoroughly. These are often for individuals who struggle to maintain an oral care practice or have avoided the dentist for an extended period.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Scaling and root planning cleaning<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":1824,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignright size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/06\/82.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1824\"\/><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Scaling and root planning cleanings also called deep cleanings, are used to treat gingivitis and periodontitis by cleaning the teeth and the gum pockets. Deep gingivitis cleanings only take a single dental session. On the other hand, periodontitis deep cleanings may necessitate numerous sessions, depending on the severity.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Scaling is the procedure that removes plaque and tartar off your tooth's surface and from gum pockets below the gum line that arise from gum disease. This type of teeth cleaning not only removes germs but also helps to minimize gum irritation. Root planing is the procedure of straightening the dental roots, which assists in the reattachment of the gums to the teeth and eliminating gum pockets.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Periodontal maintenance cleaning<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Periodontal maintenance cleanings are the type of teeth cleanings that also treat gum disease. They remove extra plaque and tartar from your tooth surface and gum pockets, then smooth out the roots, if necessary, similar to scaling and root planing. The main difference between periodontal maintenance cleanings and other dental cleanings is that they are generally conducted more often. This cleaning is performed more often because gum disease is progressive and worsens if not treated properly.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\n<h4>Conclusion<\/h4>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Depending on what your dentist discovers during your dental checkup, your dentist may recommend one of the types mentioned above of dental cleanings.

A single bridge cannot be used for non-consecutive missing teeth or on opposite sides. You qualify for a fixed bridge only if you have consecutive missing teeth on either side of the mouth.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Gum Health<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Good gum health is a prerequisite for bridge success. The two dominant signs of healthy gums are their firmness and being pink in color. Gum recession of inflammation negatively affects the appearance and fit of the bridge. It leads to further problems such as periodontal disease. An ideal candidate to undergo a fixed bridge treatment must have healthy gums before considering this restorative option.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Physical Health<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The patient must be in good physical health before going for treatment. However, if you have any specific illness, do not hesitate to share it with your dentist. For bridge placement, the tooth structure must be removed, affecting the gums. Therefore, if you have any severe illnesses like diabetes, hypertension, heart-related problems, or otherwise, make sure to discuss them with your dentist\/<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Tooth Health<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The teeth near to bridge placement must also be in good health. If they are in good health, they can support the bridge well. The fracture, decayed, or broken teeth will not hold up the bridge and might collapse. Therefore, the tooth health near bridge placement must be in good health to facilitate the bridge placement.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><li><strong>Jawbone Density<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dense and strong bone is also required to support the bridge. If the jawbone density is insufficient, the bridge will loosen and fall over time. This is because the forces from chewing will lead to bridge failure, preventing the bridge from fusing with the jawbone. A healthy and strong jawbone is crucial for bridge support.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Final Thoughts<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The ideal candidate for a fixed bridge must be relatively healthy with enough jawbone density, good gum health, and decay-free teeth. Along with these qualities, patients with one to four consecutive missing teeth are usually the best candidate to undergo this treatment. However, everyone's situation is different.

Unless tooth roots are present to stimulate the bone, it will continue to shrivel. Bone loss can have negative consequences not only for your mouth but also for your overall health.

Bone loss in the jaws occurs in everyone who has missing teeth.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental implants are the best option available when you have missing teeth, both for your dental health and for your overall health.

The fluctuations in the concentrations of different hormones lead to imbalances in the body, and the oral cavity is one of them. They can cause bleeding and swollen gums, toothaches, and sores, but they all fade away after the menstrual time.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If a woman takes birth control pills, the hormonal fluctuations during periods may cause dry sockets in her teeth.

The American Association of Orthodontics (AAO) estimates that 27% of orthodontic patients of Canada and the US belong to an adult population!&nbsp;Isn\u2019t it surprising?

As a matter of fact, this is considered to be something known as an indirect filling that is used to reform a tooth for better functionality and\u00a0improved\u00a0appearance. This is done after the decay has been removed from the tooth. Inlays and\u00a0onlays\u00a0can be made of everything from composite resin to porcelain and even gold. Their purpose is primarily to strengthen teeth as well as replace any older damaged\u00a0dental work. Most notably, they are incredibly strong and look natural. Because they are so durable, they will last for a very long time.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5><strong>Placed Inside&nbsp;the Structure&nbsp;of&nbsp;the Tooth<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Inlays are used as a way to correct a damaged or decayed tooth. After decay removal,\u00a0an\u00a0impression is\u00a0made that is sent to a laboratory that then fabricates the inlay. This is ultimately placed inside the structure of the tooth in a permanent and lasting way. Once the porcelain inlay has been placed and bonded permanently, the chances of the tooth being re-infected by bacteria becomes virtually zero. This is simply a smart way to protect teeth for the long term. With so much to offer it is clear to see why porcelain inlays are so popular today in terms of highly effective dental treatment.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5><strong>An Indirect Restoration<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":1624,\"sizeSlug\":\"full\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-full\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/08\/perfect-healthy-teeth-smile-young-woman-teeth-whitening-dental-care-stomatology-concept.jpg\" alt=\"advantages of porcelain inlays and onlays\" class=\"wp-image-1624\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Conversely, porcelain\u00a0onlays\u00a0are used primarily as a way to restore the cusps of a tooth that has become damaged or broken. They are placed in such a way that they are very much like inlays and will require at least two dental visits just as is necessary with inlays.\u00a0When\u00a0onlays\u00a0are placed they are considered to be an indirect restoration because a dental laboratory actually creates them in a handcrafted fashion. One of the big advantages of both inlays and\u00a0onlays\u00a0is that they are porcelain colored meaning that they closely match the color of natural teeth. The end result is a beautiful attractive smile as well as an improved bite.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5><strong>Less Bacterial Leakage<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With either of these important dental treatments, you can expect improved tooth contour as well as even healthier gums.

This includes everything from medical and dental considerations to a study of impressions of the teeth.

Whether it is complete dentures or partial dentures, one thing is sure and that is that people have choices today when it comes to restoring a beautiful and attractive look. First of all, partial dentures simply are a&nbsp;removable type of denture that is a good option for some patients. Partials are ideal for those who still have a large number of healthy remaining teeth. Partials are sometimes referred to simply as fixed bridges. The difference being that fixed bridges are permanent in nature while partial dentures can be removed.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":1571,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/05\/white-teeth-1.jpg\" alt=\"Large Numbers of Missing Teeth\" class=\"wp-image-1571\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5><strong>Large Numbers&nbsp;of Missing Teeth<\/strong><\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In comparison, complete dentures are sometimes referred to as full dentures and can be an excellent restoration solution for those who&nbsp;have&nbsp;lost all or almost all of their teeth. Whether they fall out naturally or are extracted, when a large number of teeth are missing, complete dentures might be the perfect solution to the problem. Generally speaking, full dentures are used for patients who have large numbers of missing teeth on both the upper and lower row.

The good news is that today\u2019s modern dentistry offers several dental restoration options for&nbsp;missing&nbsp;teeth&nbsp;to either disease or injury. One of the most common choices today to replace an individual tooth or multiple teeth is that of dental implants. It is important to note that implants look, feel, and function virtually&nbsp;the same&nbsp;as natural teeth. As a matter of fact, they&nbsp;are&nbsp;just about indistinguishable from real teeth.

Implants are typically made of titanium&nbsp;and are&nbsp;small rods that are surgically implanted into the patient\u2019s upper or lower jaw. Keep in mind that the patient must have adequate jawbone mass to accept the titanium rod. When this is not possible, a fixed bridge may be a good second solution. Considered a more noninvasive type of procedure, having a fixed bridge attached to existing surrounding teeth to support a dental crown is a good way to replace lost teeth. The good news is that a fixed bridge can be a seamless restoration that looks natural and lasts a long time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":1502,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/18965906-2.jpg\" alt=\"Dental Care Provider \" class=\"wp-image-1502\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5><strong>Consult&nbsp;with Your Dental Care Provider<\/strong><\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, a partial denture is often used&nbsp;as a way to&nbsp;restore one\u2019s functionality and appearance.

That said one of the first steps in achieving the goal of avoiding tooth decay\u00a0is to simply eat right. While many people today enjoy fast food and pleasure foods such as potato chips, candy, ice cream and cake, these are all destructive foods in terms of dental health. A better option is to consider eating fresh, healthy and nutritious food sections\u00a0of\u00a0fruits and vegetables. These foods are not only better for the teeth but there are also better for the entire body overall. At the end of the day, diet is simply a choice.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":1455,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/toppinole-img1.jpg\" alt=\"tooth decay\" class=\"wp-image-1455\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5><strong>As Foods Break Down Within\u00a0the Mouth Bacteria\u00a0is Formed<\/strong>\u00a0<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most importantly, sticky foods that\u00a0adhere\u00a0to the enamel of the teeth are perhaps most concerning of all. When foods are allowed to remain on the teeth for several hours or overnight, the end result can be catastrophic over the long term. Keep in mind that as foods break down within the mouth bacteria is formed\u00a0ultimately releasing acid that is damaging to the tooth enamel. One of the worst things that anybody can possibly do is to go to bed without brushing. This gives bacteria an entire night (while an individual sleeps) to do their dirty work. While missing one night or failing to brush one time is not catastrophic, getting into\u00a0the habit of doing this regularly can result in serious dental damage.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":1456,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/toppinole-img2.jpg\" alt=\"tooth decay\" class=\"wp-image-1456\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5><strong>A Good Home Dental Health Program<\/strong>\u00a0<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, flossing and brushing regularly as well as visiting your dental care provider at least twice each year for an examination and professional cleaning along with a good home dental health program can prove successful in preventing cavities.

This is a proven fact and has been shown through numerous studies and a wealth of research. That is why it is so important to consider all the implications with regard to periodontal disease or gum disease and how it can affect the human body. Something as simple as brushing and flossing regularly can help to mitigate the chances of\u00a0gum\u00a0disease. There are some estimates\u00a0that\u00a0up to 75% of the population has some degree of gum disease. In short,\u00a0gum disease is the result of bacteria and plaque, and tartar buildup\u00a0on teeth.\u00a0Now, let's take a closer look at the overall impact of periodontal disease. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":1426,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/subImg2.jpg\" alt=\"Lasting Impact on Long-Term Health \" class=\"wp-image-1426\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5><strong>Lasting Impact\u00a0on Long-Term Health<\/strong>\u00a0<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Whether it is gingivitis which is the beginning of\u00a0gum\u00a0disease or periodontal disease which is the next stage, one thing is sure and that is getting a handle on this problem long before it becomes more serious is absolutely essential. There are some\u00a0signs of gum disease worth considering. For example,\u00a0red, bleeding or swollen gums as well as bad breath and tooth sensitivity all point to the onset of periodontal disease. Always bear in mind that periodontal disease has a direct and lasting impact on long-term health. As a matter of fact, even more serious diseases like heart disease and stroke as well as diabetes and chronic kidney disease can all be traced back to periodontal disease in many cases.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":1425,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/02\/subImg1.jpg\" alt=\"Brush and Floss at Regular Intervals    \" class=\"wp-image-1425\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5><strong>Brush\u00a0and Floss\u00a0at Regular Intervals<\/strong>\u00a0<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The good news is that periodontal or gum disease is easily treated. The first step in dealing with this dental health issue is to remove plaque. This is usually done in a dental office by a dental hygienist. There are other ways to deal with gum disease including a variety of medications as well as even surgery when it has become a very severe case. At the end of the day, the easiest approach to dealing with gum disease\u00a0is\u00a0to simply brush and floss at regular intervals and watch what you eat. Regular routine cleanings by a dental hygienist and exams can greatly improve overall dental health as well. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/contact\/\">Contact<\/a> your Pinole dentists, Azadeh Hosseini, DDS and Ghazal Hosseini, DDS at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/\">Top Pinole Dental<\/a> today for more information on the overall impact of periodontal disease.\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<h6>References:<br>\n[1] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dentalimplantsolutions.net\/gum-diseases-and-their-symptoms\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gum Diseases And Their Symptoms<\/a><br>\n[2] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.walnutcreekdental.net\/gum-disease-signs-and-diagnosis\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Gum Disease, Signs And Diagnosis<\/a>\n<\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:html -->",

When teeth grinding&nbsp;happens&nbsp;with dentures in place or even after they are removed at night, the end result can be damage to the denture appliance itself as well as damage to soft tissue, the jawbone, and joints. In short, teeth grinding or clenching&nbsp;is hard&nbsp;on denture-type appliances. If you feel as though you have this problem - it is important to consult with your dental care provider&nbsp;as soon as possible.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":1416,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/dentures1.jpg\" alt=\"Grinding and Clenching Can Cause Serious Damage\" class=\"wp-image-1416\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5><strong>Grinding&nbsp;and Clenching Can Cause Serious Damage<\/strong><\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While there are many reasons for teeth grinding, stress is certainly one of the potential causes. Excessive external stress in your life can easily cause you to begin grinding teeth. Young and old alike experience teeth grinding in various degrees. Older individuals who wear full dentures and have never grind their teeth in the past may find that they start once they begin wearing dentures. As mentioned, grinding and clenching can cause serious damage to denture appliances and ultimately result in injury to soft tissue and bone. There is a fallacy believed by some that teeth grinding will automatically stop once you\u2019ve lost all your teeth.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":1417,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/dentures2.jpg\" alt=\"dentures\" class=\"wp-image-1417\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5><strong>If Dentures Are Poorly Fitted<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is simply not true and may continue long after dentures have been placed. That is why it\u2019s so important to take this condition seriously and talk with your dental care provider if it becomes an issue. Chewing muscles are powerful and can cause serious damage as mentioned. Also, worth noting is that consistent teeth grinding or clenching with dentures will result in changes in oral bone structure causing dentures to not fit correctly. When dentures are poorly fitted as a result of grinding or clenching, they eventually become damaged. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/contact\/\">Talk<\/a> with your Pinole dentists, Azadeh Hosseini, DDS and Ghazal Hosseini, DDS at&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/\">Top Pinole Dental<\/a>&nbsp;for more information on how teeth grinding can damage dentures.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:html -->\n<h6>References:<br>\n[1] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dentalimplantsolutions.net\/teeth-grinding-with-dentures\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Teeth Grinding With Dentures \u2013 Does It Cause Damage?<\/a><br>\n[2] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.walnutcreekdental.net\/learn-modern-dental-implant-technology\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Learn More About Modern Dental Implant Technology<\/a>\n<\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:html -->",

As a matter of fact, many things happen to teeth even while you are sleeping and unaware. Bacteria is always a major concern and that is why it is a good idea to brush and floss right before you go to bed. Depending upon how well you brush and floss each night, the level of bacteria in your mouth can vary quite substantially. For example, going to bed without brushing your teeth will greatly increase the level of bacteria in your mouth. This means that while you sleep bacteria are hard at work at damaging teeth.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":1401,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/bad-breath.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1401\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5><strong>Bad Breath&nbsp;in The Morning<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another key consideration with regard to dental health while you sleep is that the mouth simply produces less saliva while you are sleeping. This is likely a natural response so that you are not swallowing while you are sleeping. The bad news, however, is that less saliva means that bacteria and germs have more room to run. This is perhaps why many people have bad breath in the morning. Again, brushing before you go to sleep at night is one of the best ways to reduce bacteria levels.

        "content": "<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Today's modern dentistry offers huge advantages over the dentistry that was offered just a few decades ago. Perhaps most notable of all is something known as a dental implant. This is nothing more than a small post that is made of titanium that is then surgically inserted directly into the jawbone. This is an excellent option for replacing missing teeth. Once an implant has been placed, the surrounding bone is allowed to heal for several months. During the healing process, the bone will actually fuse or bond to the titanium post or screw that has been implanted. The implant itself is the actual titanium post that is placed directly into the patient's jawbone. It is important to note that not all patients are good candidates for dental implants.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":1395,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/dental-implants.jpg\" alt=\"Tooth Implant \" class=\"wp-image-1395\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Overall Current Dental Condition<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A surgeon must first determine if a patient is a good fit for a dental implant based upon an initial consultation and an oral examination. A thorough review of the patient's medical and dental history can help the dental care provider better evaluate the patient's overall current dental health. It is important to note that some patients may not have the ideal dental health needed for placing dental implants. For example, there may be some patients who have experienced high levels of bone loss. This simply means that they do not have enough bone mass for the implant to be placed properly and securely. One option to consider when this is the case is something known as bone grafting.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Several Key Considerations<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Talk with your dental care provider to learn more about the advantages and benefits of bone grafting. The good news is that those who are indeed good candidates for dental implants can have the procedure done in a fast and effective way. In most cases your dental surgeon will work with your general dental care provider to ensure the most favorable outcome. There are several key considerations that must be taken into account including tooth extraction, bone grafting and the implant surgery itself. In addition, your dental care provider will need to fabricate a temporary and permanent prosthesis or what is known as a bridge, denture or crown. Because each patient is unique and different, every case will call for different protocols.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":1397,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/dental-implants-2.jpg\" alt=\"dental implants\" class=\"wp-image-1397\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Quality of Life<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental implants are a popular choice today simply because they improve a patient\u2019s smile and overall quality of life.

This includes everything from general aesthetics to functionality and maintaining better oral hygiene through improved bone mass retention. With so much to offer it is clear to see why dental implants have become so popular in recent days.

For example, one of the most obvious reasons that a wisdom tooth should be extracted as a way to prevent future oral health problems is that it could have become impacted. Because wisdom teeth generally come in later in life, they are more frequently involved with not erupting properly. When a tooth does not erupt the way that it should it stays under the gumline and is impacted. This can cause disease, pain and even damage to surrounding teeth.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":1377,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/extracting-wisdom-teeth-1.jpg\" alt=\"No Pain Associated With Wisdom Teeth Related Problems\" class=\"wp-image-1377\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>No Pain Associated with Wisdom Teeth Related Problems<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Most dental care providers agree that extracting a wisdom tooth that is impacted is usually the best course of action. An impacted tooth may press against the roots of surrounding teeth and cause damage. This can increase the risk of dental disease and result in eventual tooth loss. Because there is almost always no pain associated with wisdom teeth related problems of this nature, the only way to know for sure is to have dental imaging done and to have a dental care provider examine your teeth completely. Talk with your dentist to find out what options are available with regard to having a wisdom tooth removed.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":1376,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\",\"linkDestination\":\"none\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/extracting_wisdom_teeth.jpg\" alt=\"A Wisdom Tooth May Partially Erupt\" class=\"wp-image-1376\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>A Wisdom Tooth May Partially Erupt<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another concern with regard to wisdom teeth that are not extracted is that they may eventually cause crowding of the teeth and teeth to become crooked.

Simply ignoring wisdom teeth related problems is not a good option. This is because eventual damage can occur when wisdom teeth that are not properly aligned or fully erupted and allowed to remain in place.

Here are some simple tips worth considering when it comes to Invisalign treatment and all that it makes possible. For example, most orthodontic care providers will recommend a specific care program for Invisalign aligners. In fact, one of the best ways to care for aligners is to simply use warm water and some type of antibacterial soap. Invisalign actually offers their own product that is used to clean the aligner trays.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":1369,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/invisalign-treatments-tips.jpg\" alt=\"Promote The Growth of Bacteria\" class=\"wp-image-1369\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Promote The Growth of Bacteria<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That said a simple solution of soap and water works equally as well. As a note of caution, never used toothpaste to clean aligner trays as this can cause damage. When aligner trays are cleaned in this way they can become scratched and can even promote the growth of bacteria. Another great piece of advice is to follow all dietary instructions as laid-out by your orthodontic care provider. For example, drink as much water as possible to stay hydrated and to reduce the chances of excessive saliva collecting in the mouth.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Following Instructions<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition, talk with your orthodontist to determine which foods should and should not be eaten when wearing aligners. Following instructions as outlined by your orthodontist can only serve to expedite the treatment and ensure the fastest improvement in how teeth are aligned. Another thing to consider when it comes to Invisalign treatment is to always try to keep the mouth as clean as possible. When teeth are not kept clean at all times especially when using aligners, bacteria can be pressed against the teeth where plaque can accumulate and cause similar problems.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":1370,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/12\/invisalign-treatments.jpg\" alt=\"Whitening Toothpaste\" class=\"wp-image-1370\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Whitening Toothpaste<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Those using Invisalign for the first time may find that whitening toothpaste is preferred to other types of toothpaste. This is typically due to the fact that most whitening toothpaste products produce better results during treatment then when they are used prior to treatment. This is simply due to the fact that the aligners actually help to keep the whitening product close to the teeth rather than it being washed away by saliva in the mouth. Anytime you're unsure with regard to using any type of product with Invisalign simply ask your dental care provider.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Follow The Instructions as Provided By Your Orthodontist<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, it is essential to use a retainer in the right way. Your orthodontic care provider will explain in detail how to properly use a retainer. Keep in mind that some patients will avoid wearing a retainer following treatment. This can result in a loss of any progress that was gained throughout the entire Invisalign treatment. Follow the instructions as provided by your orthodontist to be sure that you enjoy the best possible results with regard to your Invisalign treatment.

Considered by many to be one of the most popular types of dental procedures in use today, whitening is a cosmetic treatment that can substantially improve the outward visual appearance of teeth. Most dental care providers today offer tooth whitening treatment as a simple in office procedure. It should be noted that teeth whitening requires several procedures and is not just a one-time procedure. In addition, occasional maintenance whitening is recommended in order to ensure an ongoing bright color.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":1309,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/teeth-whitening.jpg\" alt=\"Reflect and Scatter Light from the Enamel\" class=\"wp-image-1309\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Reflect and Scatter Light from the Enamel<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>To fully understand tooth whitening it is first important to understand the structure of a tooth. The outer layer of the tooth is typically known as the enamel. Teeth have a natural white appearance because they reflect and scatter light from the enamel. However, the whiteness of teeth is also determined by the color of the dentin located directly underneath the enamel. Everyone has a different thickness and texture when it comes to tooth enamel. This is why some teeth are whiter than others. For example, those with thinner or rougher enamel will generally have less white teeth. It is also important to keep in mind that the use of alcohol or drinking too much dark colored liquids such as tea, coffee, colas and red wine can cause teeth to become less white.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":1307,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/teeth-whitening-n-its-advantages.jpg\" alt=\"Stains That Originate from Within the Tooth\" class=\"wp-image-1307\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Stains That Originate from Within the Tooth<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Even a lack of proper oral hygiene can result in teeth becoming dull in color and overall general appearance. Aging can have an affect on the brightness of teeth. As an individual ages the enamel becomes thinner while at the same time the dentin becomes darker. Another concern is that of stains that originate from within the tooth. These are known as intrinsic stains and are often caused by excessive fluoride exposure in childhood as well as the use of antibiotics. In fact, if a mother takes antibiotics during pregnancy, the child could end up having internally stained teeth. Modern tooth whitening is intended primarily for dealing with surface stains and discoloration.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":1310,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/tooth-whitening.jpg\" alt=\"Vital Whitening or Non-Vital Whitening\" class=\"wp-image-1310\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Vital Whitening or Non-vital Whitening<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, your dental care provider can use two primary types of whitening procedures to help you achieve a brighter smile. This can be either vital whitening or non-vital whitening. Vital whitening is typically used with teeth that have a live and active root. Products used for vital whitening will most often contain some type of hydrogen peroxide. The procedure when done in a dentist\u2019s office usually takes around an hour. Non-vital whitening is most frequently used for teeth that have had root canal treatment performed. This is due to the facts that the stain is coming from inside of the tooth and that the root is no longer vital or living. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/contact\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Contact<\/a> your dentists in Pinole, Dr. Azadeh Hosseini and Dr. Ghazal Hosseini at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Top Pinole Dental<\/a>, today to learn about teeth whitening and its advantages.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>References:<br>[1] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dentalimplantsolutions.net\/pros-and-cons-of-teeth-whitening\/\">Pros and Cons of Teeth Whitening<\/a><br>[2] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.walnutcreekdental.net\/how-to-make-teeth-whitening-last-longer\/\">How To Make Teeth Whitening Last Longer<\/a><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->",

Because it is such a personal issue it often goes without being addressed. However, bad breath and the related health complications must be talked about in order to be resolved. While there are many breath freshening products on the market today, masking the problem does not fix what is actually causing it to happen. Perhaps one of the most obvious reasons for bad breath or halitosis is a lack of good oral hygiene. Regular brushing, flossing and tongue cleaning is probably the best way to reduce odor.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"right\",\"id\":1302,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignright size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/what-is-the-cause-of-bad-breath.jpg\" alt=\"Systemic dehydration\" class=\"wp-image-1302\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Systemic Dehydration<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another reason that an individual may have halitosis is something known as xerostomia or dry mouth. This happens when there is a lack of saliva in the mouth. The causes of this condition are likely due to certain types of medications as well as chemotherapy or simply systemic dehydration. In addition, there are different types of oral infections and periodontal diseases that can result in strong odor in the breath. As plaque accumulates on the teeth, food particles and a variety of bacteria can cause the breath to smell unpleasant. This is clearly why good oral hygiene is so incredibly important.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":1300,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/11\/what-caused-bad-breath.jpg\" alt=\"Get to the root of what is causing dental health problems\" class=\"wp-image-1300\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Get to The Root of What is Causing Dental Health Problems<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Finally, there are a variety of medical underlying conditions that can result in halitosis or strong odor coming from the mouth. Any time individuals struggle with serious medical conditions that affect healthy teeth and gums, it is best they check with their doctor and dental care provider in a collaboration. This is a smart way to get to the root of what is causing dental health and overall general health related problems. There are a variety of diseases that can result in bad breath including everything from diabetes complications to lung infections and even bronchitis. In some rare cases even liver complications can result in halitosis. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/contact\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Talk<\/a> with your Pinole dentist, Dr. Ghazal Hosseini and Dr. Azadeh Hosseini at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Top Pinole Dental<\/a>, today to learn more about what causes bad breath and what you can do about it.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>References:<br>[1] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.walnutcreekdental.net\/why-do-i-have-bad-breath\/\">Why Do I Have Bad Breath<\/a><br>[2] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.walnutcreekdental.net\/flossing-and-its-importance-to-maintain-good-dental-hygiene\/\">Flossing And Its Importance To Maintain Good Dental Hygiene<\/a><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->",

This is simply the case because dentures are usually less desirable since they are easily noticed as being dentures. Dentures can create a sunken face appearance causing one to look older than they actually are. That said one benefit of dentures is that they are removable and easy to maintain. A popular alternative to dentures is something known as all-on-four dental implants.

Here are some reasons why dental veneers are so beneficial to those looking to improve appearance and functionality when talking about dental health. For example, dental veneers can greatly improve the overall natural appearance of one\u2019s smile. This type of dental reconstruction technique is intended to mimic the appearance of natural teeth as closely as possible. The main goal is to make the veneer look exactly like a real tooth using porcelain. Note that porcelain is highly stain resistant, tough and durable.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Minimally Invasive<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Another benefit of veneers is that the process is quick, painless and relatively easy as compared to other dental procedures. Usually it only requires two visits to perfectly fit veneers, resulting in a natural looking dental restoration. The entire process of placing veneers is usually less than one hour depending on the number of veneers that will be implanted. Another clear advantage of choosing this type of treatment is that it is minimally invasive. There is no surgery involved and there are no highly invasive procedures, such as would be the case with a root canal. No injections are required with this minimally invasive procedure.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[1240],\"align\":\"left\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery alignleft columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Dental-Veneers.jpg\" alt=\"Veneers Are So Remarkably Durable\" data-id=\"1240\" data-full-url=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/Dental-Veneers.jpg\" data-link=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/?attachment_id=1240\" class=\"wp-image-1240\"\/><\/figure><\/li><\/ul><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:gallery -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Veneers Are So Remarkably Durable<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>All that is necessary for this procedure is for your dental care provider to remove a very thin layer of enamel that is then sent to the lab. With easy maintenance and no special care required, dental veneers are maintained the same way you would maintain your natural teeth. Proper dental hygiene is all that is necessary. Finally, because veneers are so remarkably durable, and permanent, they will resist decay and stains over the years far better than would be the case with natural teeth.

As a matter of fact, dental implants are offered in a full range of sizes, types and heights. Your dental care provider will help you to choose which option is best for your dental needs. There are primarily two types of dental implants available today. One is known as Endosteal, which involves implants that are placed directly into the jawbone. This type of implant is produced using a very hard metal known as titanium and is shaped in the form of a small screw.

In addition, there are other techniques that can be used for patients who do not have adequate jawbone mass.

A crown is nothing more than a tooth shaped cap that is placed directly over a tooth to return it to its original size, shape and intended function. There are different types of material that can be used to create a crown. This includes everything from porcelain fused to metal to ceramics and metal alloys as well as even composite resin and porcelain. The color of a crown is matched as closely as possible to mimic your natural teeth. When custom crafting and fulfilling the dental crown treatment, the shape, color and function of the tooth are all considered.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Preparing the Tooth<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Crowns are used for a number of different reasons including everything from protecting a weak tooth from further decay to preventing breaks or cracks in an already weakened tooth. They are also used to cover teeth that are poorly shaped or discolored. This is usually done in a cosmetic capacity to improve one\u2019s smile. Crowns can also be used to restore broken teeth or replace a cavity that is too large. They are also used in many cases to hold a dental bridge in place or to make other types of cosmetic modifications. The first step in having a dental crown fitted is preparing the tooth. This takes usually about 90 minutes and involves the dentist removing any decay and taking measurements to make sure that the crown will fit perfectly.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[1230],\"align\":\"left\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery alignleft columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/dental-crown1.jpg\" alt=\"A Perfect Cosmetic Finished Appearance\" data-id=\"1230\" data-full-url=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/09\/dental-crown1.jpg\" data-link=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/?attachment_id=1230\" class=\"wp-image-1230\"\/><\/figure><\/li><\/ul><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:gallery -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>A Perfect Cosmetic Finished Appearance<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Next the tooth is built up to provide additional support for the crown. After all this has been completed your dentist will place a temporary crown. This is to protect the tooth while a permanent dental crown is being made in the lab. In most cases the permanent crown will take about two weeks to be created. Once the new crown is available, you can expect to return to your dentist to have it fitted permanently. The dentist simply removes the temporary crown and cements the new permanent crown in place resulting in a perfect cosmetic finished appearance.

It\u2019s true. Gum disease is a serious concern and flossing regularly can stop it from ever happening. Home dental hygiene practices including flossing, brushing and eating right can save a lot of trouble later on down the road. Keep in mind that even though you are brushing thoroughly that you are not completely cleaning your teeth if you are not flossing. Because a brush is flat and teeth have many tiny curves it is virtually impossible to clean completely with only a brush.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Flossing Can Save The Day<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That said, bacteria typically hang out in tiny crevices and curves and around the teeth. Bacteria ultimately leads to plaque. Flossing can save the day in this regard. Plan to floss either in the morning when you first wake up or at night prior to going to bed. This will ensure that food particles, bacteria and other undesirable matter will be removed thoroughly. The actual process involves using approximately 18 inches of floss that can be wound between two fingers. Sliding the floss between teeth is best, then push the floss back and forth and create a curve or C-shaped around each tooth to help remove debris.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[1223],\"align\":\"left\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery alignleft columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Floss.jpg\" alt=\"Key to Maintaining Long-Term Excellent Dental Health\" data-id=\"1223\" data-full-url=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Floss.jpg\" data-link=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/?attachment_id=1223\" class=\"wp-image-1223\"\/><\/figure><\/li><\/ul><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:gallery -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Key to Maintaining Long-Term Excellent Dental Health<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Gently rub the floss along the gum line up and down from the top to the bottom of each tooth. Always remember to floss all teeth including teeth at the far back of the mouth. Conversely, some people choose a water pick or other water flossing devices. These are good too if they are used properly. As a final note, always remember that flossing is one of the keys to maintaining long-term excellent dental health. This combined with regular routine dental checkups and professional cleanings will ensure that your teeth look great well into the later years of life.

While fillings are typically used to fill in small cavities and crowns are used when decay is deeper or more severe, there may be cases where fillings are not enough and where a crown may be too much. The placement of dental inlays and onlays are in many cases used as an alternative when either of the other mentioned treatments is not the best option. While more substantial than a filling, inlays and onlays are not as involved as the placement of a crown which requires the removal of a considerable amount of tooth material.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Dental Technology<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Inlays are simply used it to fill in cavities or areas in a tooth that are between the cusps. Conversely, onlays also fill in cavities and areas in the tooth but may be used to cover one or multiple cusps. This type of dental technology is similar in many ways to crowns but will not cover the entire surface of the tooth. For example, while a crown is all-encompassing and essentially is used to replace the entire top of the tooth, inlays and onlays can be used in a more targeted way covering only areas of the tooth requiring repair or restoration. Both inlays and onlays are custom molded or crafted to fit into the chewing surface of the tooth where there has been decay or damage or perhaps even injury.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[1215],\"align\":\"left\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery alignleft columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Inlay-Onlay-Treatment.jpg\" alt=\"Porcelain or Composite Material\" data-id=\"1215\" data-full-url=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/08\/Inlay-Onlay-Treatment.jpg\" data-link=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/?attachment_id=1215\" class=\"wp-image-1215\"\/><\/figure><\/li><\/ul><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:gallery -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Porcelain or Composite Material<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Your dental care provider will use an imprint of the affected area that is then sent to the lab in order to create a perfect inlay or onlay.

Regular routine brushing and flossing is one of the best ways to keep your teeth in top condition through all stages of life. Failing to maintain proper care of teeth can result in serious damage to the gums, teeth and mouth in general. Keep in mind that poor oral hygiene cannot only result in cavities and gum disease but serious periodontal disease with long-lasting effects. As a matter of fact, periodontal disease can have a direct effect on overall long-term health. The disease can lead to everything from heart disease to stroke and even diabetes. For example, researcher has indicated that gum disease can cause heart disease in people of various ages. Studies have also shown that there may be some other side effects of periodontal disease on cardiac health.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Infection Including Gum Disease<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With regard to stroke, scientists have found that periodontal disease may increase the risk of stroke in older adults. A serious oral infection in older individuals can have lasting implications in terms of having a stroke. People who have already been diagnosed with diabetes are proven to be more likely to have gum disease than those who are not living with this type of debilitating disease. In short, diabetes makes it easier to fall victim to infections including gum disease. Not surprisingly, periodontal disease can lead to difficulties associated with diabetes, while diabetes can lead to the possibility of gum disease.

Teeth that emerge from the gum-line normally will typically not require surgery.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[1202],\"align\":\"left\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery alignleft columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/surgery.jpg\" alt=\"Dental Surgery Helps to Relieve Discomfort\" data-id=\"1202\" data-full-url=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/surgery.jpg\" data-link=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/surgery\/\" class=\"wp-image-1202\"\/><\/figure><\/li><\/ul><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:gallery -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Dental Surgery Helps to Relieve Discomfort<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>That said, there are many instances where a tooth will not emerge correctly or at all. When this happens, dental surgery is usually the best option. Molars that fail to emerge or that emerge misaligned are known as impacted teeth. This type of tooth is literally trapped between the gums and the jawbone. Dental surgery helps to relieve the discomfort associated with impacted teeth. Impacted teeth can produce pain, swelling and even infection. Surgical procedures are an effective way of helping to prevent more serious problems. With so much to offer it is clear to see why oral surgery has become such an important part of overall dental care. Even those having dental implants placed will require some amount of surgical procedures. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/contact\/\">Talk<\/a> with your dentists in Pinole, Azadeh Hosseini, DDS and Ghazal Hosseini, DDS at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/\">Top Pinole Dental<\/a> today for more information on surgical dentistry in Pinole, CA and the surrounding areas.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>References:<br> [1] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.walnutcreekdental.net\/learn-more-about-surgical-dentistry\/\">Learn More About Surgical Dentistry<\/a><br> [2] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dentalimplantsolutions.net\/modern-dental-implant-options\/\">Modern Dental Implant Options<\/a><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->",

Many people are also in the same situation and they are wondered on how to use dental insurance wisely - however, some may not be making best use of this important resource. As a matter, fact most patients do not fully understand how dental insurance works. The best way to make full use of insurance for dental care is to plan ahead. For example, planning treatments throughout the year at the right time can make the best use of insurance resources and gain you the most return on your insurance investment. Minimizing out-of-pocket expenses is also an important consideration.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Dental Insurance Policy<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A dental insurance policy is like any other type of insurance we have in our life including car and home insurance. If there is an emergency, insurance comes in handy. Knowing the deductible and the co-pay is important when choosing any type of insurance product. Insurance is primarily intended to reduce enormous and expensive bills that must come out of pocket. Dental insurance is a little different than other types of insurance in that it is not primarily focused on emergencies although it can be used for emergencies. In many cases this type of insurance is focused primarily on preventative care.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Routine Dental Care<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dental insurance is something that is used each and every year if it is used properly.

Understanding and fully knowing the details of your plan is how you can get the most out of this kind of insurance.

Here are just a few reasons why digital dental x-rays are so advantageous to dental patients today. Comparing digital dental x-rays vs. film x-rays, digital ones are healthier because they produce up to 70% less radiation than more traditional film x-rays. Another clear advantage of using this type of technology when it comes to modern dentistry is that it simply takes less time and is much easier to process as compared to film.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Less Pain and Less Discomfort<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Equally impressive is the fact that today\u2019s modern digital x-rays offer streamlined design. This means that there is less pain and less discomfort when patients have x-rays taken. The sharp edges of traditional film often cut and cause abrasions in the mouth. While traditional film x-rays for dentistry certainly helped dentists over the years, they are not able to produce the viewing quality found in their digital counterpart. One thing that dentists and patients alike really enjoy about digital dental x-rays is that they are instant and real time. This means that dental problems can be detected quicker and more accurately. Unlike film x-rays, digital means there is virtually no waiting time involved in terms of seeing the final product. Digital x-rays along with a wide range of other modern dental advances means less time in the chair for patients. When patients have shorter visits there is less anxiety and improved overall quality of care.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:gallery {\"ids\":[1184],\"linkTo\":\"none\",\"align\":\"left\"} -->\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gallery alignleft columns-1 is-cropped\"><ul class=\"blocks-gallery-grid\"><li class=\"blocks-gallery-item\"><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Digital-dental-x-ray.jpg\" alt=\"Digital Imaging is Less Expensive\" data-id=\"1184\" data-full-url=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/06\/Digital-dental-x-ray.jpg\" data-link=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/?attachment_id=1184\" class=\"wp-image-1184\"\/><\/figure><\/li><\/ul><\/figure>\n<!-- \/wp:gallery -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Digital Imaging is Less Expensive<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With so much to offer it is clear to see why digital x-rays for dentistry have become the standard in most practices today. These types of x-rays can be quickly transferred from one dentist to another or to a specialist as necessary. Being portable, digital images can follow a patient to anywhere imaging is needed. Digital imaging is less expensive and is also more environmentally friendly making it a win, win situation for all involved. Regardless the type of x-rays used, the clear advantage is that the dentist is able to see things that would otherwise go unnoticed.

It is key to note that children are typically more prone to tooth decay and gum disease than adults. This may be because children do not have the discipline to maintain routine home dental care and because of their diet.

In fact, the explanation of this condition is really not that complex. The temporomandibular joint connects the skull and the jaw. When this joint becomes damaged or injured in some way it may result in chronic pain known as TMJ or temporomandibular joint syndrome. Everything from injury to the jaw, to teeth that are misaligned or even a jaw that is not correctly joined can result in TMJ. In addition, the clenching or grinding of teeth as well as arthritis, gum chewing, stress or even poor posture can result in this sometimes very painful condition.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Localized Ear Pain<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Those who think they may have TMJ should know that there are a few clear and obvious symptoms associated with the condition. For example, if the jaw clicks or pops or is constantly in pain this may be a clear sign that TMJ is present. In addition, everything from earaches to localized ear pain or popping sounds in the ears can indicate that the condition is present. Other common symptoms include locking of the jaw joint as well as temporal pain and sore or stiff muscles in and around the jaw area.

Those who frequently chew gum should avoid this activity as it may aggravate TMJ. Reducing stress in one\u2019s life can also help with the disorder. If home treatment does not achieve the desired results than medical care may be necessary. Dental splints and a wide range of other dental treatments can be used to help with the condition.

The impact of periodontal disease should never be underestimated. Keep in mind that one of the easiest ways to prevent and avoid periodontal disease is to simply have regular routine brushing and flossing habits in place. This along with biannual meetings with your dentist for checkups and professional cleanings can keep periodontal disease or gum disease at bay permanently. Gum disease is nothing more than the problems caused by bacteria from plaque and tartar buildup. Periodontal disease can even be caused by certain types of medication as well as tobacco use and clenching or grinding of the teeth. There are even suggestions that genetics may have a direct relationship to periodontal disease.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>When Gingivitis Goes Untreated<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are two types of gum disease. One is known as gingivitis and the other is more advanced periodontal disease. Gingivitis is nothing more than the beginning stage of gum disease. It often goes undetected, but the good news is that gingivitis is completely reversible. Conversely, periodontal disease happens when gingivitis goes untreated. It is effectively the next and more dangerous stage of gum disease. This level of gum disease results in chronic inflammatory response eventually leading to the breakdown of bone and tissue in the infected area. Ultimately, there is bone and tooth loss. That is why it is so important to stay ahead of the problem in order to prevent tooth loss and other issues. There are several signs and symptoms associated with the disease. This includes everything from red and bleeding gums to gums that are excessively swollen.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":1167,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/periodontal-disease.jpg\" alt=\"Pinole Dentist\" class=\"wp-image-1167\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>High Levels of Bacteria are Present<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition, bad breath, tooth sensitivity and receding gums along with abscessed teeth and tooth loss may all indicate the presence of periodontal related disease. Perhaps most troubling of all is that periodontal disease can result in more serious systemic problems. This includes everything from heart disease to stroke and diabetes as well as chronic kidney disease and even preterm birth. For example, scientific research has shown that gingivitis can cause an increase in the risk of heart disease and stroke. This is due to the fact that higher levels of bacteria are present in the mouth that eventually move throughout the body. Equally of concern is that those with diabetes are more susceptible to gum disease while those with gum disease are more susceptible to diabetes. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/contact\/\">Contact<\/a> your Pinole dentist office, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/\">Top Pinole Dental<\/a>, the practice of Azadeh Hosseini, DDS and Ghazal Hosseini, DDS today for more information.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>References:<br> [1] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lagunaparkdentistry.com\/side-effects-of-periodontal-diseases-as-they-relate-to-overall-health\/\">Side Effects Of Periodontal Diseases As They Relate To Overall Health<\/a><br> [2] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dentalimplantsolutions.net\/periodontics-and-you\/\">Periodontics and You<\/a><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->",

It is a natural mineral that is essential to oral health and has been used as a treatment for decades. Fluoride supports healthy tooth development and strong enamel. It also fights bacteria that can harm and damage teeth as well as the gums. The main focus of fluoride treatment is to protect the outer layer of the tooth known as the enamel. This type of treatment can reduce the risk of developing cavities. Keep in mind that cavities develop when bacteria builds-up on the teeth and gums over time. Bacteria when given time can produce plaque that results in acid which erodes teeth and gum tissue. If the plaque is given enough time to break down the tooth enamel layer, bacteria can then work its way into the inner part of the truth affecting nerves and blood at the tooth core.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Fluoride Mouthwash<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The good news is that professional fluoride treatments can help to reduce the chances of having teeth become damaged because of plaque and tartar buildup. Your dentist will provide a professional application of fluoride in the form of a highly concentrated varnish, foam, gel or rinse. The treatment is typically applied using an array of different techniques. It can be applied using everything from a fluoride mouthwash to brush or tray or even a swab. Best of all, the treatment only takes a few minutes and has lasting effects on protecting the teeth. In most cases patients should avoid eating or drinking for up to an hour following the treatment or application. This allows the fluoride to become fully absorbed into the tooth enamel.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":1147,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/04\/Fluoride.jpg\" alt=\"Pinole Dentist\" class=\"wp-image-1147\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Preventative Options<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Working closely with your dental care provider is the best way to ensure that you gain the most from this type of preventative treatment. In addition to fluoride application, children may be given the option to have sealant applied as a way to protect teeth from damaging bacteria. Your dentist will know for sure which technique or strategy would be best for you and your children. Either way one thing is sure and that is that today\u2019s modern dentistry offers many preventative options as a way to keep teeth healthy, strong, vibrant and attractive.

For example, crowns can be placed on a child\u2019s teeth if there are large areas of decay where a filling simply will not work.

The good news is that pediatric dentistry is very easy to understand and is a vital part of overall health and wellness in infants as well as adolescent children alike. A pediatric dentist is essential to the long-term dental health and wellness of children as they grow and develop. They are professionals who have completed additional training and study in dentistry that focuses on children\u2019s dental care. Dental care for children covers a wide range of developmental issues and conditions. A pediatric dentist will offer everything from the treatment and care of cavities to dental injuries and gum disease as well as treating conditions associated with baby teeth development. For example, baby teeth that fall prematurely may require unique treatment. In most cases a dentist will provide the child with space maintainers to help ensure that adult teeth emerge normally.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Impacted Teeth and Abscesses<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Pediatric dental care focuses on the prevention and treatment of a wide range of conditions and ensures the best possible dental care for children. From dental exams to routine cleanings and x-rays, there are many aspects of childhood dental care that must be considered. Treatment can include everything from jawbone related problems to impacted teeth and abscesses as well as dental decay and even tumors. This type of dental professional may also even teach parents how to help their kids develop good habits and avoid bad habits such as thumb sucking and pacifier dependence. In short, a dental care professional that focuses primarily on pediatrics covers all aspects of dental care in children of all ages including infancy and adolescence and well into the teenage years.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":1118,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Pediatric-Dentistry.jpg\" alt=\"Work Closely with a Trusted Dental Care Provider\" class=\"wp-image-1118\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Work Closely with a Trusted Dental Care Provider<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>With so much to offer it is clear to see why pediatric dentistry is so important today. Other aspects of this type of dental care include dealing with everything from improper bite to straightening teeth using braces. Even removing wisdom teeth is a focus of pediatric care. Managing gum disease and diagnosing and treating various types of medical conditions that are associated with poor oral health such as diabetes and hyperactivity are also considered. Parents can gain a lot from all the modern pediatric dentistry has to offer children.

Root canal treatment is highly effective at repairing and saving teeth rather than having them removed. However, keep in mind that not all teeth are good candidates for root canal treatment. Talk with your dental care provider to determine whether or not you are a good candidate for this type of procedure. The actual root canal repair involves removing the pulp or soft tissue inside the tooth where nerves are present. Blood vessels are also in this area and are used to normally nourish a tooth. Often this region of the tooth can become infected.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Necessity For Root Canal<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Everything from a deep cavity to trauma and injury as well as a cracked or fractured tooth can result in the necessity for root canal. Even repeated dental treatments may end up disturbing tissue resulting in the need for root canal treatment. Keep in mind that if the tooth with an infected pulp goes untreated, the tissue around the root can ultimately become infected causing more serious problems. Often patients feel pain and swelling and can get an abscess when this happens. Even more alarming is that an infection can result. Infection is a serious concern because it can put a patient at risk of losing the tooth completely. This is simply due to the fact that bacteria can damage the actual bone associated with the tooth that ensures the tooth stays connected to the jawbone.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Endodontics<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>It is important to note that root canal therapy is usually not performed during a regular routine checkup. Your dental care provider will need to schedule a follow-up appointment. In many cases patients may be referred to a specialist known as an endodontics who works specifically with pulp and tissues within natural teeth. In most cases this type of procedure will take one or two office visits to complete. In typical situations there is virtually no pain associated with root canal treatment. In fact, once the procedure has been completed, the patient will no longer feel any pain because nerve endings have been removed.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":1112,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Root-Canal.jpg\" alt=\"Prescribe Antibiotics\" class=\"wp-image-1112\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Prescribe Antibiotics<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Following root canal therapy, patients may feel sensitivity for a few days around the tooth where the procedure was performed. Usually a mild over-the-counter pain medication will suffice. In other instances your dental care provider may prescribe antibiotics if there is any sign of infection. Most patients will be required to do a follow-up visit after root canal therapy. It is during this visit that the temporary filling is removed and replaced with a permanent filling as well as a crown to protect the tooth from damage.

A poor diet can have a direct impact on oral health and dental wellness. For example, sugar is one of the most damaging things to tooth enamel and is found in most modern diets. As a matter fact, sugar is known to be one of the main contributing factors associated with deteriorating or poor oral health. Food, drinks and the like all contain sugar that targets the teeth and ultimately sticks and clings to the outer surface of the tooth. This eventually leads to harmful plaque developing. Eventually plaque causes erosion of the tooth enamel with the end result being cavities. Even refined carbohydrates found in bread and similar foods can produce virtually the same negative effects.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Drinking Water After Eating Acidic Foods<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Perhaps one of the best ways to establish better oral health and dental hygienist to simply eliminate sugary foods and foods that are acidic. The main reason for this is that acidic foods while in some ways healthy for your body can actually cause the enamel of the tooth to deteriorate over time. Everything from tomatoes to lemons and oranges, while again healthy for your body, can result in deterioration of the tooth enamel. Some have suggested that drinking water after eating acidic foods or brushing immediately following an acidic meal is a good remedy. Water is highly effective because it causes the production of saliva to increase thereby reducing acidity in the mouth. Perhaps one of the best ways to enjoy great dental health and beautiful looking teeth is to simply eat all foods and drink in moderation. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":1105,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/02\/Healthy-Diet.jpg\" alt=\"Teaching Children at a Very Early Age the Proper Aspects of Dental Hygiene\" class=\"wp-image-1105\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Teaching Children at a Very Early Age the Proper Aspects of Dental Hygiene<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is really the first step in achieving better oral health.

Finally, teaching children at a very early age the proper aspects of dental hygiene is an excellent idea. When children learn early on how to take care of their teeth, they are more likely to continue these patterns well into adulthood.

After understanding what a teeth deep cleaning is the next question becomes \u201cdo I need a professional type of cleaning of this nature.\u201d The answer to this simple question is that if a patient is beginning to show signs of gum disease than a deep cleaning of the teeth is highly recommended. The first thing that a dentist typically does to determine if a deep cleaning is necessary is check the depth or the spaces of the periodontal pockets located between teeth and gums.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Excessively Deep Spaces May Point to Early Stages of Gum Disease<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>If limits have been exceeded in this regard then a deep cleaning is clearly advised. Your dentist will use something known as a periodontal probe to measure the spaces between the teeth and gums. Keep in mind that excessively deep spaces may point to early stages of gum disease. The deep cleaning is intended to reverse gum disease resulting in better oral health. The main objective of a deep cleaning of the teeth is to remove plaque and tartar from the teeth as well as below the patient\u2019s gum line.

In essence, a veneer or dental veneer is nothing more than a thin cover that is permanently adhered to teeth in order to provide a more natural shape and look for teeth.

Placed directly over the front or visible part of the tooth, veneers look exactly like natural teeth and can also frequently be used to address stained teeth. Dental veneers are frequently used when teeth are so heavily stained that they cannot be whitened using bleaching. Today's modern veneers are usually made of composite resin material or porcelain. Your dental care provider can help you choose the material that will work best for your specific dental requirements.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Provide A Natural Looking Surface<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In some cases patients can be fitted with porcelain veneers.

Porcelain veneers are beneficial for a number of reasons including that they are strong and long lasting and provide a natural looking surface. Most importantly, with porcelain less tooth enamel is removed than when a cap or crown is fitted. As an added advantage, porcelain veneers are desirable because they do not stain as easy as other materials.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":1058,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/01\/Dental-Veneer-Benefits.jpg\" alt=\"Composite Resin Veneers Are Easy To Repair\" class=\"wp-image-1058\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Composite Resin Veneers Are Easy To Repair<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Conversely, composite resin veneers are crafted from tooth colored material that is then bonded to the teeth. Composite resin veneers are desirable for a number of reasons including that they cost less than porcelain. In addition, less tooth enamel must be removed as compared to having crowns or porcelain veneers placed. Another benefit of composite resin veneers is that they are easy to repair if they become damaged. While not as durable or strong as porcelain, composite veneers can be fixed quickly and easily. Prior to getting veneers it is important to consult with your dental care provider to determine if your teeth and gums are healthy enough for this type of treatment. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Grinding May Cause Dental Veneers To Crack<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Any tooth disease or decay must be addressed prior to having veneers placed. In addition, patients who have an issue with grinding their teeth may find that veneers are not the best option. Grinding can cause dental veneers to crack, break or chip. Patients should also understand that once veneers have been applied that they are not removable. Another consideration with regard to veneers is that they can loosen up over time in some instances. When this happens, replacement veneers are required. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/contact\/\">Contact<\/a> your Pinole dentist, Azadeh Hosseini, DDS and Ghazal Hosseini, DDS at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/\">Top Pinole Dental<\/a> today to learn more about today's modern dental veneer benefits.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>References:<br> [1] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.walnutcreekdental.net\/veneers-and-their-benefits\/\">Veneers and Their Benefits<\/a><br> [2] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lagunaparkdentistry.com\/tips-on-how-to-keep-dental-veneers-clean\/\">Tips On How To Keep Dental Veneers Clean<\/a><br> [3] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.dentalimplantsolutions.net\/aspects-of-modern-cosmetic-dentistry\/\">Understanding More About Cosmetic Dentistry<\/a><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->",

When gums begin to recess a variety of dental health related problems will typically follow. This includes everything from increased sensitivity to hot and cold food and beverages to even tooth loss. When gum recession becomes a problem, gum grafting is often the best solution. Gum health is absolutely essential to long-term overall dental wellness and maintaining a beautiful radiant smile. When the gums pull away from the teeth it exposes the tooth root and that is why gum grafting surgery is so vital to correcting this problem. Gum recession can affect up to 10% or more of adults. Most importantly, many people do not even know that they have a problem with gum recession until it has reached more advanced stages.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Regular Routine Dental Checkups<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The good news is that there are many ways to prevent the need for gum grafting surgery. For example, having regular routine dental checkups and professional cleanings by a dental hygienist can greatly reduce the chances of periodontal disease. When heavy plaque and tartar buildup over time periodontal disease can ultimately set in causing a full range of oral health related problems. Equally of concern is poor oral hygiene and even the genetics of the patient.

This means brushing and flossing after each and every meal and doing so in the right way. Today it is easier than ever before to research online how to properly brush your teeth and how to floss in the right way.

A diet that consists of fresh fruits and vegetables not only is gentler on the teeth but it also provides better nutrition resulting in stronger and healthier teeth and gums. In essence, a healthy diet is a win-win for anyone\u2019s teeth. Equally important is to refrain from other types of bad behavior such as cigarette smoking or the use of smokeless tobacco. These items can stain and damage teeth and directly affect the quality of a person\u2019s smile.

While there are many ways to whiten teeth at home it is always recommended to work with your dental care provider to have professional whitening performed. This will ensure that the procedure is done the right way and that the right types of products are used in order to achieve the best possible results. Finally, there is also the option of cosmetic procedures that can enhance a smile. For example, a gummy smile where too much gum line is showing can be corrected through a modern type of surgical procedure that effectively adjusts the gum line. As an added note, practice smiling in the mirror frequently in order to make your smile more natural and more attractive.

When left untreated this disease can advance and eventually lead to tooth loss as well as other health related issues. Keep in mind that advanced stages of periodontitis began as gingivitis. This is simply a milder degree of what is commonly referred to as periodontal disease. The disease progresses by causing the gums to become red, swollen and to a point where they will eventually bleed rather easily. While there is virtually no pain at this stage, and the damage is already being done.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Professional Treatment<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In most cases gingivitis begins by a lack of oral hygiene. The good news is that this disease is fully reversible if caught early enough. This is especially true when professional treatment combined with good dental home care is administered as soon as possible. Gingivitis can begin for a number of reasons. This includes everything from genetically related disposition to diabetes, diet, smoking and aging. Even stress, poor nutrition and fluctuations in hormones as well as pregnancy and substance abuse can all contribute to the onset of gingivitis. As mentioned, when gingivitis goes untreated it eventually becomes periodontitis. As the disease progresses, plaque will eventually spread and move below the gum line. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":917,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/174.jpg\" alt=\"Destruction of Tissue\" class=\"wp-image-917\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Destruction of Tissue<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Bacteria produce toxins that will over time irritate the patient's gums. The end result is something known as chronic inflammatory response. This ultimate results in bone and tissue that normally support teeth to become weak, diseased and broken down. This destruction of tissue will eventually result in gums separating from the teeth. This ultimately causes pockets to form that will promote further bacterial growth and infection. Once the disease progresses the pockets will become deeper and more pronounced ultimately resulting in even more tissue destruction. Eventually tooth loss results. Maintaining a healthy diet and regular oral hygiene is the best antidote. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/contact\/\">Contact<\/a> your dentists in Pinole, Azadeh Hosseini, DDS and Ghazal Hosseini, DDS at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/\">Top Pinole Dental<\/a> today to learn more.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>References:<br> [1] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.walnutcreekdental.net\/2018\/09\/12\/who-is-a-periodontist-and-what-is-periodontics\/\">Who Is A Periodontist And What Is Periodontics?<\/a><br> [2] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lagunaparkdentistry.com\/side-effects-of-periodontal-diseases-as-they-relate-to-overall-health\/\">Side Effects Of Periodontal Diseases As They Relate To Overall Health<\/a><br> [3] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/2019\/10\/05\/side-effects-of-periodontal-disease-and-its-impact-on-overall-health\/\">Side Effects Of Periodontal Disease And Its Impact On Overall Health<\/a><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->",

Making the most of unused dental insurance plan benefits is a smart way to maintain good oral health and overall wellness. Keep in mind that if your dental insurance plan is on a calendar year, there are number of smart and effective ways to get the most out of your plan. For example, check your benefits each year to know what you have remaining before the year comes to an end. Anytime you are unsure of what benefits you may still have available it is easy to simply contact your dental office to obtain this information. Equally important is to make sure that you receive the treatment you need before you deductible resets.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Out-Of-Pocket Expenses<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a reminder, a deductible for dental care is the amount of money that a patient must pay to the dentist out-of-pocket prior to the insurance company paying for any dental services received. In most cases the deductible will be about $50 per year. This deductible begins again each year as the plan rolls over. Typically, dental insurance providers offer little to no coverage until the patient has met their out-of-pocket expenses. Keep this simple fact in mind and plan accordingly as a way to maximize your dental insurance benefits. It is also important to keep track of your annual maximum, which is the limit on how much an insurance company will pay for dental work in a given year.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Calendar Year Schedule<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":906,\"sizeSlug\":\"large\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft size-large\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/11\/End-of-year-Benefit.jpg\" alt=\"Premiums For Dental Insurance\" class=\"wp-image-906\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In most cases an insurance company will pay around $1000 per year per person for dental care. Always remember that if your plan is on a calendar year schedule that any unused benefits will not roll over to the next year. Those who pay monthly premiums to a dental insurance company should make it a point to have regular routine dental cleanings to prevent dental problems such as cavities or gum disease. Staying proactive in this regard maximizes the return on your investment in dental insurance while also ensuring the best possible dental health going forward. This makes sense especially considering the fact that dental problems that are left untreated can become more severe over time.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Premiums For Dental Insurance<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Always avoid putting off treatment especially when you are paying monthly premiums for dental insurance. Delaying dental care can only result in more extensive and expensive treatment at a later time. For example, something as simple as a minor cavity could easily turn into a more expensive and more time-consuming procedure such as root canal treatment. As the end of the year approaches for those who are on a calendar based dental insurance program, it is best to use up the remaining benefits available to you prior to the plan rolling over. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/contact\/\">Contact<\/a> your dentists in Pinole, Azadeh Hosseini, DDS and Ghazal Hosseini, DDS at<a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/\"> Top Pinole Dental<\/a> today to learn more about how to use your dental insurance benefits.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>References:<br> [1] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.walnutcreekdental.net\/2018\/10\/24\/end-of-year-considerations-and-dental-insurance\/\">End of Year Considerations and Dental Insurance<\/a><br> [2] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/patients\/\">Patients' Information<\/a><br> [3] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/how-early-should-kids-visit-their-dentist\/\">How Early Should Kids Visit Their Dentist?<\/a><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->",

In addition, crowns are sometimes used as a way to cover teeth that are badly shaped or severely discolored. This is ultimately done to improve a patient\u2019s smile. Keep in mind that crowns are made from a variety of different type of materials today. They can be made from ceramics, metal alloys and even composite resin. In some cases a combination of different types of material can be used to create the perfect crown. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":876,\"align\":\"left\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/10\/dental-crown.jpg\" alt=\"Prepare The Tooth\" class=\"wp-image-876\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Prepare The Tooth<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When a crown is made it involves the mixing of different materials in such a way that they are colored and blended to match the patient's natural teeth. When a crown is placed, the dentist will prepare the natural tooth by removing its outer portion, in essence making way for the new crown. Any decay is also removed and any additional artificial tooth structure may be added as needed to support the crown. In fact, there are many cases where the dentist will be required to build up the core of the tooth in order to accommodate the crown in the best way possible.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Finished Crown<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Other aspects of placing a dental crown include the dentist taking an impression of the original tooth so that an exact model can be made for crown placement. Patients typically will receive a temporary crown while they are waiting for the permanent crown to arrive. The wait time is usually just a few weeks in most cases. Once the finished crown is ready, your dentist will place it in the right way to ensure a perfect bite. The crown is permanently cemented in place providing patients with years of excellent functionality and a better appearance. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/contact\/\">Contact<\/a> your Pinole dentists, Dr. Azadeh Hosseini and Dr. Ghazal Hosseini at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/\">Top Pinole Dental<\/a> today to learn more about dental crown placement.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>References:<br> [1] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.walnutcreekdental.net\/2019\/01\/12\/crowns-or-caps-know-the-basics\/\">Crowns or Caps \u2013 Know the Basics<\/a> <br> [2] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.lagunaparkdentistry.com\/dental-implants-vs-dental-bridges\/\">Dental Implants vs Dental Bridges<\/a><br> [3] <a href=\"https:\/\/dentalimplantsolutions.net\/how-long-does-a-dental-crown-procedure-take\/\">How Long Does A Dental Crown Procedure Take?<\/a><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->",

The good news is that a full mouth reconstruction typically restores full functionality and an impressive appearance including a beautiful smile. Reconstructive dentistry of this nature is often used when a patient has severe tooth decay, many missing teeth or difficulty chewing or extreme bone loss in the jaw. Even teeth that are worn because of years of teeth grinding can be remedied through full dental reconstruction procedures.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Snaps Directly Into Previously Placed Dental Implants<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One option with regard to reconstructive procedures in dentistry includes replacing all teeth in a unique and innovative way. In this case dental implants are placed and then artificial teeth or a full denture is snapped into place onto the implants. Something that is known as an overdenture snaps directly into previously placed dental implants. The great thing about implant overdentures is that they can be taken off and replaced as often as necessary by the patient. Yet another option with regard to full mouth reconstructive procedures is something known as a hybrid implant denture.

That is simply due to the fact that dental sealants are an excellent way of protecting teeth in young and old alike. In essence, sealants are nothing more than a thin plastic coating that is used to protect the chewing surface of the teeth. Most notably this type of sealant is used on children\u2019s back teeth to protect from cavities and tooth decay. Sealants are designed to protect the small pits and grooves located throughout the upper surface of young developing teeth. These rough and uneven areas are typically highly susceptible to cavities and tooth decay.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Sealants Are Easy To Apply<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Germs and particles of food easily become stuck in the pits and groves and can be missed during a normal brushing routine. Sealants are designed to fill in these groves as a way to prevent food and germs from becoming lodged in these areas. Children typically will receive sealants on permanent back molars once they have emerged. Sealants are easy to apply where the procedure is performed in a dental office. Because the sealant material is liquid in nature it is simply painted on and hardens quickly to create a protective shield over the tooth.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":582,\"align\":\"left\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/Dental-Sealant.jpg\" alt=\"Regular Checkups Twice A Year\" class=\"wp-image-582\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Regular Checkups Twice A Year<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Talk with your dental care provider to determine which type of gel dental sealant will be best for your child\u2019s needs.

The traditional bridge is probably the most popular and is in most cases made of porcelain that has been fused to metal.

Bridges are also commonly used to help patients regain functionality and the ability to speak better. Most importantly, a bridge is an excellent option for greatly improving one\u2019s smile.

The real question becomes which option is better for an individual patient based on their unique and individual needs. For example, dental implants are particularly desirable simply because they are so permanent and lasting in nature. They are permanently and surgically implanted into the jawbone and eventually fuse with the patient\u2019s natural bone. This makes them a very strong and lasting anchor for an artificial tooth.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Bone Grafting May Correct The Problem<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One consideration in this regard is that some patients may not have enough healthy jawbone mass to accommodate dental implant titanium screws. When this is indeed the case there may be situations where bone grafting may serve to correct the problem. If bone grafting is not an option, then dental bridges may be a better solution for the patient. With dental bridges, aesthetics and functionality can be effectively restored. However, to do this the dentist is required to modify surrounding healthy teeth. By filing down neighboring teeth, the dentist can create a firm and solid anchor for an artificial tooth or multiple teeth.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":565} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/08\/implants-vs-min-925x425.jpg\" alt=\"Longer Lasting And More Reliable\" class=\"wp-image-565\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Longer Lasting And More Reliable<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While the cost of each technology is similar in many ways, dental implants can be a little more costly yet they are longer lasting and more reliable.

That said there are some things that a patient can do as a way to best protect their teeth until they are able to visit with a dental care provider. For example, if a tooth becomes chipped or broken it is best to save the piece of the tooth that is become dislodged. Your dental care provider may have options that would otherwise not be available in this regard. It may even be possible to reattach a portion of a tooth that has broken off unexpectedly.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Cracked Teeth Can Be Treated<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>When you know for sure that you have cracked one of your teeth it is best to schedule an appointment with your dental care provider as soon as possible. This is especially true when pain is experienced intermittently or in a more chronic way. Always remember that cracked teeth can be treated but it is essential to meet with your dentist as soon as possible. This will help to reduce the chances of further damage. In severe cases of a chipped or broken tooth you should rinse your mouth out with salt water.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":548,\"align\":\"left\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Chipped-Tooth-Repair.jpg\" alt=\"Consider Covering Any Sharp Edges\" class=\"wp-image-548\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Consider Covering Any Sharp Edges<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is important because it can reduce the chances of infection. A simple mixture of table salt and warm water swished around in the mouth for about a minute can greatly reduce the chances of infection. Another option with regard to a chipped tooth or broken tooth is to consider taking over-the-counter pain medication. This is an important step in alleviating pain until you are able to meet with your dentist. Finally, consider covering any sharp edges of a broken tooth with dental wax or something similar. This will help to prevent injury to the soft tissue within the mouth. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/contact\/\">Contact<\/a> your dentists in Pinole, Azadeh Hosseini, DDS and Ghazal Hosseini, DDS at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/\">Top Pinole Dental<\/a> for more information about dealing with a chipped tooth.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>References:<br> [1] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.walnutcreekdental.net\/blog\/2018\/12\/28\/how-porcelain-veneers-can-help\/\">How Porcelain Veneers Can Help <\/a><br> [2] <a href=\"https:\/\/dentalimplantsolutions.net\/how-long-does-a-dental-crown-procedure-take\/\">How Long Does A Dental Crown Procedure Take?<\/a><br> [3] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/2019\/06\/21\/learn-more-about-dental-crown-treatment\/\">Learn More About Dental Crown Treatment<\/a><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->",

That said people often lose teeth by accident or simply due to disease and decay. Whether it is gum disease or a routine tooth extraction, the result is a gap between the teeth making it difficult or uncomfortable to chew. There is a wide range of options that should be considered when it comes to filling the gap. Dental bridges are one such option. Regardless of pros and cons of dental bridges as solution for restoring a lost tooth, they are simply a fixed type of dental restorations that will fill an empty space that is the result of a missing tooth.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Typically Be A Better Choice As Compared To Dentures<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>An artificial tooth is firmly affixed in place where there is a gap as the result of a missing tooth. Here are some pros and cons to consider when it comes to dental bridges. Perhaps most notable of all in terms of a bridge is that it is a fixed solution. A dental bridge will typically be a better choice as compared to dentures. This is due to the fact that dentures are not permanent in nature and may move for fallout. Dental bridges are permanent, fixed and do not fall out.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":541,\"align\":\"left\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/Before-Dental-Bridges.jpg\" alt=\"The Support Of Adjoining Teeth\" class=\"wp-image-541\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>The Support Of Adjoining Teeth<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Best of all with dental bridges you can brush normally without ever having to remove the appliance. One drawback of dental bridges is that it requires the modification of perfectly healthy neighboring teeth. Some patients may find that bridges are not the best option because of this reason. Simply stated, to affix dental bridges requires the support of adjoining teeth. These adjoining teeth must be shaved down as a way to accept a cap or crown in order to place the dental bridge in a permanent and lasting way. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/contact\/\">Contact<\/a> your Pinole dentists, Dr. Azadeh Hosseini and Dr. Ghazal Hosseini at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/\">Top Pinole Dental<\/a> for more information on dental bridges and the various benefits of this important dental restoration option.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>References:<br> [1] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.walnutcreekdental.net\/blog\/2019\/03\/29\/porcelain-bridges-and-how-they-help\/\">Porcelain Bridges and How They Help<\/a><br> [2] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/2019\/03\/29\/learn-more-about-porcelain-bridges\/\">Learn More About Porcelain Bridges<\/a><br> [3] <a href=\"https:\/\/dentalimplantsolutions.net\/missing-teeth-restoration-options\/\">Missing Teeth - Restoration Options<\/a><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->",

For example, metal braces and Invisalign are two of the most prominent technologies that allow dental care providers to achieve the desired results when it comes to creating a more functional and more attractive smile. Here are some of the most obvious considerations when talking about Invisalign vs braces. For example, both technologies will effectively straighten teeth. However, while Invisalign is fully removable, metal braces are not.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>New Aligners Are Worn Every Few Weeks<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition, Invisalign offers the advantage of clear orthodontic aligners that are virtually invisible while being worn. Conversely, metals braces have brackets, wires and spacers as well as rubber bands that are clearly visible and can have a direct impact on one\u2019s personal self-confidence. Equally of concern is that with Invisalign new aligners are worn every few weeks while with metal braces patients must go for regular dental appointments to have routine tightening and replacement of wires as necessary. Invisalign is completely or virtually invisible while metal braces can never be fully invisible. Finally, Invisalign does not require any type of retainer where with metal braces a retainer is required even after braces have been removed for two years or more. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":535,\"align\":\"left\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/07\/invisalign.jpg\" alt=\"Correcting Overcrowded Teeth\" class=\"wp-image-535\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Correcting Overcrowded Teeth<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While the cost of both technologies is similar, there are some instances where metal braces would be preferred over Invisalign. For example, for more complicated orthodontic treatment, traditional braces are often the preferred option.

With oral sedatives, the patient is fully awake but far less anxious.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"align\":\"left\",\"id\":522} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/sedation-dentistry.jpg\" alt=\"Put The Patient To Sleep Until The Drug Has Worn Off\" class=\"wp-image-522\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Put The Patient To Sleep Until The Drug Has Worn Off<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In other instances patients may require intravenous sedatives.

That said there are a few considerations that should be taken into account when deciding upon teeth whitening in-home vs. in-office. For example perhaps one of the biggest concerns with home whitening products is that they can cause excessive sensitivity in teeth. In some cases home kits can actually result in damage to gums. Equally of concern is poor fitting trays when purchasing whitening kits over-the-counter. Poor fitting trays are usually the reason for increased sensitivity and injured gums. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>A Trained and Licensed Dental Care Provider<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In short, when whitening solution is allowed to leak out it comes into contact with gums resulting in tissue damage. That is why choosing to have teeth whitening done in a dental office is a much smarter option today. As a note, it is best to avoid ever having teeth whitened in a salon. An untrained individual can end up causing serious damage to teeth and gums. Play it safe and seek out the assistance of a trained and licensed dental care provider when having teeth whitened. Teeth whitening performed by a dentist will always be safe and effective. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":515,\"align\":\"left\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/06\/getty_rf_photo_of_home_tooth_whitening.jpg\" alt=\"More Effective and Even Work Faster\" class=\"wp-image-515\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>More Effective and Even Work Faster<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A professional teeth-whitening procedure will actually end up saving you time, trouble and money in the short and long term.

Most importantly, the amount of brightness can be exactly controlled in a dental office setting. The dentist can adjust the shading and color in order to create a more natural appearance for the patient.

In addition, surgical procedures in dentistry sometimes are necessary as a way to correct developmental conditions. For example, the surgical repair of a cleft plate is one common procedure. Even cases involving a cleft lip can be addressed through surgical dentistry. Surgical dental procedures can improve speech, oral functionality and appearance.

Perhaps most amazing of all is the fact that most root canals can be completed in under an hour. As a matter of fact, the process of numbing a tooth and cleaning it out as well as filling it can easily be done in less than one hour in most cases. As a matter of fact, the question of how long does a root canal treatment take varies widely from patient to patient and from case to case. Depending on the tooth in question as well as the degree of decay, root canal therapy varies widely, to say the least.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Saving A Tooth From Extraction<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>There are typically three main elements of any root canal. This includes enlarging and shaping the space within the tooth known as the root canal. Next, the root canal space is disinfected and then ultimately is filled with a rubber like material. This technique has proven successful over the years in eliminating decay and saving a tooth from extraction. When the root canal is performed it is imperative that the disinfecting solution reaches into every part of the root canal space.

It is also important to note that some root canal treatment procedures may require multiple visits. As mentioned earlier, every root canal is different and unique and requires a custom approach by your dental care provider.

Anytime you have bleeding of the mouth or experience the loss of a tooth or even an abscessed tooth, you should seek out dental care as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Seeking Immediate Treatment Is Always The Best Strategy<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a matter of fact any oral problems that include symptoms like excessive bleeding, chronic pain or tooth loss should be considered a dental emergency. Severe infections can be life threatening and that is why even infections should be addressed by a dental care provider as soon as possible. Seeking immediate treatment is always the best strategy. Emergencies include everything from a fractured tooth, to tooth loss or an infected tooth. While every emergency cannot be covered here, common sense should prevail and it is best to always error on the side of caution.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":492,\"align\":\"left\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/05\/iStock-655370908.jpg\" alt=\"Identify Problems In The Earliest Stages Of Development\" class=\"wp-image-492\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Identify Problems In The Earliest Stages Of Development<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>One of the best ways to avoid dental emergencies is to maintain good oral hygiene and have routine dental exams and cleanings.

In essence, gum diseases can cause heart disease. The key to understanding this problem is inflammation. Inflammation of the gums and tissue within the oral cavity can directly have an effect on the heart. Gums that are red and painful produce what is known as gingivitis. This is simply the result of too much acid in the mouth due to poor dental hygiene. Periodontitis is the type of gum disease that is related to heart disease. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Bacteria May Also Result in Plaque<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>The gums are full of blood vessels, and this can in effect contribute to bacteria and inflammation spreading to many other parts of the body. Inflammation is a very serious issue and can even result in damage to the blood vessels. This is why the heart is at risk when it comes to the inflammation associated with gum disease. In other studies, there is a suggestion that bacteria may also result in plaque that can form in the coronary arteries. All this can produce stroke and chronic heart disease.

In this case a dental implant is a smart option because it does not require any modification to surrounding teeth, as is often the case with bridges. As an added bonus dental implants are very effective at helping to retain natural bone mass in the jaw. When teeth go missing and there is no tooth root requiring support, the bone mass naturally decreases over time. With dental implants bone mass loss is stopped or greatly reduced.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":455,\"align\":\"left\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/04\/implant-opt.jpg\" alt=\"Dental Implants Are Truly a Win-Win For Dental Patients\" class=\"wp-image-455\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Dental Implants Are Truly a Win-Win For Dental Patients<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>This is important also because good bone mass helps to protect other surrounding healthy teeth. In short, dental implants can actually help to preserve existing teeth by not only strengthening the jaw but by also negating the need for modifying surrounding teeth. Dental implants are truly a win-win for dental patients today. In addition, dental implants can be used as a way to replace multiple teeth in patients.

That said one of the most popular kinds of dental bridges used in modern dentistry is something known as a porcelain bridge. A porcelain dental bridge is unique because it can help patients improve their dental health quite substantially. Most importantly, a porcelain bridge will greatly improve one\u2019s smile adding to self-esteem and overall self-confidence. Porcelain bridges have many uses and purposes including being able to close a tooth gap in what would otherwise be an attractive smile.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Improve Facial Structure By Supporting The Overall Facial Shape<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition, porcelain bridges help to improve overall oral functionality and allow for better speaking and eating capabilities. As an added advantage, porcelain bridges like other types of bridges also help to improve patient appearance. No less important is the fact that this type of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/porcelain-fixed-bridges\/\">dental bridge<\/a> is highly useful in supporting the patient\u2019s underlying jawbone.

This is especially true for patients who have lost teeth through either injury or disease. A bridge is typically anchored on each side using a prosthetic tooth that is made of porcelain. While the concept is rather simple, a porcelain dental bridge can produce dramatic results for those wishing to improve their outward appearance. All that is really required is a natural tooth on either side of the bridge and the end result can be quite stunning. Whether a patient has lost teeth to decay, trauma or extraction, a porcelain bridge is a smart solution for patients of just about any age. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/contact\/\">Contact<\/a> your dentist in Pinole, Dr. Azadeh Hosseini and Dr. Ghazal Hosseini at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/\">Top Pinole Dental<\/a> today for more information on porcelain crowns.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":6} -->\n<h6>References:<br> [1] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.walnutcreekdental.net\/blog\/2019\/03\/29\/porcelain-bridges-and-how-they-help\/\">Porcelain Bridges and How They Help<\/a><br> [2] <a href=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/2019\/03\/02\/tooth-extractions-and-pain\/\">Tooth Extractions and Pain \u2013 What You Need To Know<\/a><\/h6>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->",

For many years the conventional wisdom was that root canal treatment is a very painful event. This is in fact simply not the case. In truth, root canal therapy is a smart and effective solution to a common dental problem. It solves the issue of an infected, dead or injured tooth root. A long time ago there were few options when it came to dealing with a tooth that had a compromised root or root system. Today this is no longer the case. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>Tooth Development During The Early Stages of Life<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Root canal offers the option of removing the faulty root and replacing it with an inert material. Because the root of a tooth is primarily for tooth development during the early stages of life, it is really not needed as an adult. That said, once the root has been replaced the tooth will continue to function normally. The key benefit here is that the patient gets to keep his or her natural tooth. This is of major benefit because keeping a natural tooth is always preferred to having to replace a tooth. <\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:image {\"id\":418,\"align\":\"left\"} -->\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"alignleft\"><img src=\"https:\/\/www.toppinoledental.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2019\/03\/Root-Canal-Therapy.jpg\" alt=\"A Smart Approach To Dental Health\" class=\"wp-image-418\"\/><\/figure><\/div>\n<!-- \/wp:image -->\n\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":5} -->\n<h5>A Smart Approach To Dental Health<\/h5>\n<!-- \/wp:heading -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>In addition, by keeping the natural tooth in place, a patent has the advantage of maintaining better bone density or bone mass within the jaw. When bone mass is maintained, there is less chance that surrounding teeth will fall due to a lack of bone and gum tissue. So it becomes very obvious that root canal treatment is a smart approach to dental health.
